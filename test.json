                "<span class=\"bold\">Art is a mirror</span>. It reflects not only ourselves, but the world around us—allowing us to more clearly see our place within it. <span class=\"bold\">The greatest artworks reward deep examination</span>. Our engagement with that art rewards us with a<span class=\"bold\"> deeper insight</span> into who we are, providing a roadmap to navigate the ever-changing landscapes of the world we inhabit.",
                "In the late 19th century, electricity, bicycles, and countless other technologies we now take for granted were <span class=\"bold\">radical innovations</span>. For the first time, telescopes and microscopes entered private homes, opening minds to realms beyond our immediate vision and <span class=\"bold\">expanding human perception</span> in unprecedented ways. A<span class=\"bold\"> revolutionary artistic movement </span>emerged in this era, attempting to <span class=\"bold\">bridge the gap</span> between the <span class=\"bold\">old world and the new </span>with flowing vines entwining humanity with machinery; a reminder, at a pivotal moment in history, of our connection with Nature and each other, a poetic labor to build a bridge between the things we knew and the things we imagined possible: <span class=\"bold\">Art Nouveau.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Alphonse Mucha</span> considered <span class=\"text-italic\">The Lord's Prayer</span> the greatest poem ever written, and his metaphysical interpretation of the text was <span class=\"bold\">unlike anything the world had seen before</span>. The artist, exhausted by commercial success, demanded that his most important work be produced in only 510 copies and then had the plates completely destroyed. This visionary artwork was Mucha’s <span class=\"bold\">love letter to humanity</span>- and while it was often spoken of, it remained hidden for a century, with only esoteric book collectors and academics intimate with its contents.&nbsp;",
                "In 2019, we released the first edition of Thomas Negovan's detailed analysis of the history which informed the work and reproduced Mucha's artworks nearly to full scale, a massive 16\" tall tome. The next edition was revised and expanded with a section devoted to Le Pater's censorship by the church, published only as a 9\" x 12\" paperback.",
                "The new edition is the expanded text, revised and presented in the original massive 12\" x 16\" hardcover scale.",
                "For over a century, the mystical symbols embedded within <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span> were dismissed as imagination. <span class=\"bold\">Fortunately, where art academia fails, occult academia rewards.</span>",
                "Over the course of twenty-five years, author <span class=\"bold\">Thomas Negovan</span> traced the esoteric roots of <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span>—decoding its hidden messages, spiritual symbolism, and forgotten history. His findings were revealed in a groundbreaking book, <span class=\"bold\">the most innovative study of Art Nouveau in decades</span>.",

                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is releasing their second album: a collection of violin and piano arrangements celebrating some of the most iconic Studio Ghibli scores ever written.",
                "Matthew Castle and Luke Vergobi previously collaborated on Matthew’s album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span>, which charted at number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. That experience affirmed something they had already felt for years while making music together: this partnership deserved its own name, its own sound, and its own future. This new album marks the first official release under the duo name Castle &amp; Vergobi.",
                "This project features music from Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo, Princess Mononoke, and The Boy and the Heron. Twelve sweeping tracks, each lovingly arranged for violin and piano, reimagining the melodies that defined entire childhoods and continue to move audiences around the world.",
                "Every piece on this album was originally composed by the incomparable Joe Hisaishi, whose longtime collaboration with director Hayao Miyazaki shaped the emotional heartbeat of Studio Ghibli. His music is wonder, tenderness, adventure, melancholy, and hope all at once. This album is our way of honoring that legacy while offering something new and intimate through the voice of violin and piano.",
                "Over the past year, we have been arranging, rehearsing, refining, and dreaming about this record. Now we are ready to bring it into a professional studio and turn it into something truly special.",
                "Your support will help fund the studio space, sound engineers, production, mixing, and mastering needed to create an album that does justice to this extraordinary music.",
                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is the classical duo formed by Matthew Castle on violin and Luke Vergobi on piano.",
                "Matthew is a professional violinist and recording artist whose album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span> reached number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. Luke has been playing piano since he was seven years old and studied music at the University of Washington. He brings a lifelong dedication to his craft and a deep sensitivity as a collaborator and arranger.",
                "For the past year, this project has lived in our living room, our home studio, and our daily routines. These arrangements were not rushed. They were built slowly, with care, curiosity, and a deep love for the worlds these melodies come from. Each track has been shaped to highlight the warmth of the violin, the emotional range of the piano, and the cinematic quality that makes this music so enduring.",
                "This is not just another album for us. It is a personal artistic statement and the beginning of Castle &amp; Vergobi as a duo.",
                "Backing this campaign means helping two independent classical musicians create an album with the resources it deserves.",
                "Studio Ghibli’s music is deeply emotional and technically demanding. Capturing it properly requires a professional recording space, experienced engineers, and thoughtful production. Your support directly enables us to step into that space and work with the people who can help bring out every breath, bow stroke, and nuance in these performances.",
                "This campaign is also about community. Many of us grew up with these films. Their music comforted us, inspired us, and stayed with us long after the credits rolled. By backing this project, you are helping transform that shared love into something tangible that can live in people’s homes, headphones, and hearts.",
                "You are not just pre-ordering an album. You are helping create it.",
                "Backers of this campaign will receive access to a range of rewards designed to bring you closer to the music and the process behind it.",
                "Supporters will be able to receive digital downloads of the full album, along with digital sheet music arranged by Castle &amp; Vergobi for select tracks.",
                "Physical rewards will include signed CDs and vinyl records, created as keepsakes meant to be cherished, displayed, and played for years to come.",
                "We are also offering a special opportunity for backers to have their name printed in the CD and vinyl liner notes. This album would not exist without the people who help bring it to life, and we want to honor that by permanently including our supporters in the physical history of the project.",
                "Every reward tier helps move this album from dream to reality, and we are deeply grateful for every person who chooses to be part of this journey.",
                "Thank you for believing in this music and in us.",

                "They work the same way: a spinning motor turns gears, gears move rods, and rods push the sanding head back and forth. We asked ourselves a simple question: Do we really need all of this just to move a sanding head?",
                "That’s when we went back to first principles. What do you actually need for perfect, controlled sanding? <span class=\"bold\">Direct, precise, linear motion. Nothing more.</span>",
                "This vertically mounted motor <span class=\"bold\">sends power straight to the sanding head</span> — no gears, no rods, just fast, snappy strokes.&nbsp;",
                "Detail sanding is a balancing act—too fast, and you ruin it; too slow, and you waste hours. And isn’t it ironic? Most “detail sanders” fail right where the work gets tricky.&nbsp;",
                "NeoSander hits the tight spot—<span class=\"bold\">a real detail sander that actually gets the details done.</span>",
                "Fast is great—but only if you can control it. Too much speed, like with rotary tools, can cause kickback, dig in, and mess things up. <span class=\"bold\">The right sanding motion is what lets you make the most of speed.</span>",
                "NeoSander’s straight-line motion covers more area efficiently, sanding fast while keeping your workpiece free from gouges—<span class=\"bold\">ideal for detailed work.</span>",
                "Nothing speaks louder than seeing it in action:",
                "But if the sanding head can’t reach the tight spot you want, all that high-speed motion means nothing.<br><br>That’s why NeoSander comes with <span class=\"bold\">8 head shapes</span> — each built for a different kind of tricky detail.",
                "The right head gets you there, but <span class=\"bold\">the right grit makes it shine</span>. NeoSander comes with 8 grits of sandpapers—taking you from rough shaping to mirror-smooth finishing.",
                "For better conformity on every surface, we created the Master Sandpaper Kit. Each grit includes <span class=\"bold\">3 standard sandpapers</span> and <span class=\"bold\">1 foam-layered sandpaper</span>, delivering a smoother finish and better contact on curves and uneven surfaces.",
                "Foam-Layered Sandpaper maintains consistent contact across uneven surfaces, absorbs excess pressure, and delivers controlled material removal—<span class=\"bold\">avoiding over-sanding on high spots while evenly sanding the entire surface.</span>",
                "When you’ve only got one set of sanding heads, limits everywhere — and changing grits can sometimes feel like a… <span class=\"bold\">Peel-and-Stick Marathon.</span>",
                "And one more thing: pick up your tool after some time… wait, what grit was this again? For detail-obsessed makers, losing track like that also disrupts your flow—exactly why <span class=\"bold\">a complete, organized system is a must.</span>",
                "With this color-coded combo, your grits always stay sorted and ready to swap. From coarse to fine, <span class=\"bold\">just grab the head you need, snap it on, and keep sanding.</span>",
                "The same back-and-forth motion that sands with ease <span class=\"bold\">also drives a saw blade effortlessly</span>, letting you flow seamlessly from sanding delicate details to cutting small pieces.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">wave-shaped double-tooth pattern</span> works perfectly with the reciprocating linear motion—one row cuts while the other clears debris—<span class=\"bold\">delivering faster, smoother cuts and reducing binding.</span>",
                "Have you noticed? NeoSander moves so fast, with strokes so tiny you can barely see — and yet <span class=\"bold\">every pass is spot-on precise.</span>",
                "At a fixed 13,000 SPM, NeoSander lets you fine-tune the stroke length (<span class=\"bold\">0.6–1.8 mm</span>) to control sanding speed, delivering a precise linear speed of <span class=\"bold\">260–780 mm/s</span>. ",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">*Linear speed formula: Speed (mm/s) = Stroke × 2 × SPM ÷ 60</span>",
                "These tight, controlled strokes deliver up to <span class=\"bold\">76%</span> more <span class=\"bold\">precision and reduce overreach</span> compared to other reciprocating sanders.",
                "The wobblier the strokes, the more the sanding head drifts—right into places you don’t want it to go.",
                "NeoSander is a different story: its reciprocating linear motor delivers the most direct, controlled strokes no other sander can match. No gears, no rods, <span class=\"bold\">no wandering sanding heads—precision guaranteed.</span>",
                "Most sanders aren’t built for pressure—they stall right away when pushed, low speed makes it worse.",
                "While most traditional sanders jam—gears lock, rods bind—when you push too hard, NeoSander just keeps going. Its adjustable-stroke linear motor ensures <span class=\"bold\">smooth, continuous motion no matter the challenge.</span>",
                "And the vibration doesn’t stop at your grip—it travels into the workpiece, buzzing your other hand. Before long, your hands go numb and precision slips away.",
                "To solve this, NeoSander uses a <span class=\"bold\">counterweight that moves opposite the sanding head</span>, canceling out most vibration and keeping your grip steady, even at full speed.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">No bulky housings blocking your view, no cords pulling you off balance</span>—just a compact tool that fits right in your palm and moves with your hand wherever the detail leads.",
                "Want to level up your sanding even further? <span class=\"bold\">Start with a cleaner cut</span>—because great sanding always begins before you even start sanding.",
                "NeoBlade, a <span class=\"bold\">Wireless Ultrasonic Cutter</span>, delivers <span class=\"bold\">precise, smooth cuts</span> with a blade vibrating at <span class=\"bold\">40,000 times per second</span>—leaving less work for NeoSander and smoother results overall.",
                "NeoSander masters the details. NeoBlock, on the other hand, handles the bigger surfaces.&nbsp;<br><br>When you crave the classic control of a sanding block, NeoBlock delivers—with <span class=\"bold\">quick-swap modular design</span> and <span class=\"bold\">secure belt tension</span>. Together, they cover every sanding need—from fine details to broad strokes.",
                "After the success of NeoBlade, we kept asking ourselves: could the same mechanism work for detail sanding? We tried, we tested… and quickly realized ultrasonic vibration wasn’t the answer.&nbsp;",
                "That challenge sparked a bigger question: how do we build a sanding tool that makers actually need — one that can tackle even the trickiest, tiniest details with ease?",

                "<span class=\"bold\">Art is a mirror</span>. It reflects not only ourselves, but the world around us—allowing us to more clearly see our place within it. <span class=\"bold\">The greatest artworks reward deep examination</span>. Our engagement with that art rewards us with a<span class=\"bold\"> deeper insight</span> into who we are, providing a roadmap to navigate the ever-changing landscapes of the world we inhabit.",
                "In the late 19th century, electricity, bicycles, and countless other technologies we now take for granted were <span class=\"bold\">radical innovations</span>. For the first time, telescopes and microscopes entered private homes, opening minds to realms beyond our immediate vision and <span class=\"bold\">expanding human perception</span> in unprecedented ways. A<span class=\"bold\"> revolutionary artistic movement </span>emerged in this era, attempting to <span class=\"bold\">bridge the gap</span> between the <span class=\"bold\">old world and the new </span>with flowing vines entwining humanity with machinery; a reminder, at a pivotal moment in history, of our connection with Nature and each other, a poetic labor to build a bridge between the things we knew and the things we imagined possible: <span class=\"bold\">Art Nouveau.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Alphonse Mucha</span> considered <span class=\"text-italic\">The Lord's Prayer</span> the greatest poem ever written, and his metaphysical interpretation of the text was <span class=\"bold\">unlike anything the world had seen before</span>. The artist, exhausted by commercial success, demanded that his most important work be produced in only 510 copies and then had the plates completely destroyed. This visionary artwork was Mucha’s <span class=\"bold\">love letter to humanity</span>- and while it was often spoken of, it remained hidden for a century, with only esoteric book collectors and academics intimate with its contents.&nbsp;",
                "In 2019, we released the first edition of Thomas Negovan's detailed analysis of the history which informed the work and reproduced Mucha's artworks nearly to full scale, a massive 16\" tall tome. The next edition was revised and expanded with a section devoted to Le Pater's censorship by the church, published only as a 9\" x 12\" paperback.",
                "The new edition is the expanded text, revised and presented in the original massive 12\" x 16\" hardcover scale.",
                "For over a century, the mystical symbols embedded within <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span> were dismissed as imagination. <span class=\"bold\">Fortunately, where art academia fails, occult academia rewards.</span>",
                "Over the course of twenty-five years, author <span class=\"bold\">Thomas Negovan</span> traced the esoteric roots of <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span>—decoding its hidden messages, spiritual symbolism, and forgotten history. His findings were revealed in a groundbreaking book, <span class=\"bold\">the most innovative study of Art Nouveau in decades</span>.",

                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is releasing their second album: a collection of violin and piano arrangements celebrating some of the most iconic Studio Ghibli scores ever written.",
                "Matthew Castle and Luke Vergobi previously collaborated on Matthew’s album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span>, which charted at number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. That experience affirmed something they had already felt for years while making music together: this partnership deserved its own name, its own sound, and its own future. This new album marks the first official release under the duo name Castle &amp; Vergobi.",
                "This project features music from Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo, Princess Mononoke, and The Boy and the Heron. Twelve sweeping tracks, each lovingly arranged for violin and piano, reimagining the melodies that defined entire childhoods and continue to move audiences around the world.",
                "Every piece on this album was originally composed by the incomparable Joe Hisaishi, whose longtime collaboration with director Hayao Miyazaki shaped the emotional heartbeat of Studio Ghibli. His music is wonder, tenderness, adventure, melancholy, and hope all at once. This album is our way of honoring that legacy while offering something new and intimate through the voice of violin and piano.",
                "Over the past year, we have been arranging, rehearsing, refining, and dreaming about this record. Now we are ready to bring it into a professional studio and turn it into something truly special.",
                "Your support will help fund the studio space, sound engineers, production, mixing, and mastering needed to create an album that does justice to this extraordinary music.",
                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is the classical duo formed by Matthew Castle on violin and Luke Vergobi on piano.",
                "Matthew is a professional violinist and recording artist whose album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span> reached number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. Luke has been playing piano since he was seven years old and studied music at the University of Washington. He brings a lifelong dedication to his craft and a deep sensitivity as a collaborator and arranger.",
                "For the past year, this project has lived in our living room, our home studio, and our daily routines. These arrangements were not rushed. They were built slowly, with care, curiosity, and a deep love for the worlds these melodies come from. Each track has been shaped to highlight the warmth of the violin, the emotional range of the piano, and the cinematic quality that makes this music so enduring.",
                "This is not just another album for us. It is a personal artistic statement and the beginning of Castle &amp; Vergobi as a duo.",
                "Backing this campaign means helping two independent classical musicians create an album with the resources it deserves.",
                "Studio Ghibli’s music is deeply emotional and technically demanding. Capturing it properly requires a professional recording space, experienced engineers, and thoughtful production. Your support directly enables us to step into that space and work with the people who can help bring out every breath, bow stroke, and nuance in these performances.",
                "This campaign is also about community. Many of us grew up with these films. Their music comforted us, inspired us, and stayed with us long after the credits rolled. By backing this project, you are helping transform that shared love into something tangible that can live in people’s homes, headphones, and hearts.",
                "You are not just pre-ordering an album. You are helping create it.",
                "Backers of this campaign will receive access to a range of rewards designed to bring you closer to the music and the process behind it.",
                "Supporters will be able to receive digital downloads of the full album, along with digital sheet music arranged by Castle &amp; Vergobi for select tracks.",
                "Physical rewards will include signed CDs and vinyl records, created as keepsakes meant to be cherished, displayed, and played for years to come.",
                "We are also offering a special opportunity for backers to have their name printed in the CD and vinyl liner notes. This album would not exist without the people who help bring it to life, and we want to honor that by permanently including our supporters in the physical history of the project.",
                "Every reward tier helps move this album from dream to reality, and we are deeply grateful for every person who chooses to be part of this journey.",
                "Thank you for believing in this music and in us.",

                "They work the same way: a spinning motor turns gears, gears move rods, and rods push the sanding head back and forth. We asked ourselves a simple question: Do we really need all of this just to move a sanding head?",
                "That’s when we went back to first principles. What do you actually need for perfect, controlled sanding? <span class=\"bold\">Direct, precise, linear motion. Nothing more.</span>",
                "This vertically mounted motor <span class=\"bold\">sends power straight to the sanding head</span> — no gears, no rods, just fast, snappy strokes.&nbsp;",
                "Detail sanding is a balancing act—too fast, and you ruin it; too slow, and you waste hours. And isn’t it ironic? Most “detail sanders” fail right where the work gets tricky.&nbsp;",
                "NeoSander hits the tight spot—<span class=\"bold\">a real detail sander that actually gets the details done.</span>",
                "Fast is great—but only if you can control it. Too much speed, like with rotary tools, can cause kickback, dig in, and mess things up. <span class=\"bold\">The right sanding motion is what lets you make the most of speed.</span>",
                "NeoSander’s straight-line motion covers more area efficiently, sanding fast while keeping your workpiece free from gouges—<span class=\"bold\">ideal for detailed work.</span>",
                "Nothing speaks louder than seeing it in action:",
                "But if the sanding head can’t reach the tight spot you want, all that high-speed motion means nothing.<br><br>That’s why NeoSander comes with <span class=\"bold\">8 head shapes</span> — each built for a different kind of tricky detail.",
                "The right head gets you there, but <span class=\"bold\">the right grit makes it shine</span>. NeoSander comes with 8 grits of sandpapers—taking you from rough shaping to mirror-smooth finishing.",
                "For better conformity on every surface, we created the Master Sandpaper Kit. Each grit includes <span class=\"bold\">3 standard sandpapers</span> and <span class=\"bold\">1 foam-layered sandpaper</span>, delivering a smoother finish and better contact on curves and uneven surfaces.",
                "Foam-Layered Sandpaper maintains consistent contact across uneven surfaces, absorbs excess pressure, and delivers controlled material removal—<span class=\"bold\">avoiding over-sanding on high spots while evenly sanding the entire surface.</span>",
                "When you’ve only got one set of sanding heads, limits everywhere — and changing grits can sometimes feel like a… <span class=\"bold\">Peel-and-Stick Marathon.</span>",
                "And one more thing: pick up your tool after some time… wait, what grit was this again? For detail-obsessed makers, losing track like that also disrupts your flow—exactly why <span class=\"bold\">a complete, organized system is a must.</span>",
                "With this color-coded combo, your grits always stay sorted and ready to swap. From coarse to fine, <span class=\"bold\">just grab the head you need, snap it on, and keep sanding.</span>",
                "The same back-and-forth motion that sands with ease <span class=\"bold\">also drives a saw blade effortlessly</span>, letting you flow seamlessly from sanding delicate details to cutting small pieces.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">wave-shaped double-tooth pattern</span> works perfectly with the reciprocating linear motion—one row cuts while the other clears debris—<span class=\"bold\">delivering faster, smoother cuts and reducing binding.</span>",
                "Have you noticed? NeoSander moves so fast, with strokes so tiny you can barely see — and yet <span class=\"bold\">every pass is spot-on precise.</span>",
                "At a fixed 13,000 SPM, NeoSander lets you fine-tune the stroke length (<span class=\"bold\">0.6–1.8 mm</span>) to control sanding speed, delivering a precise linear speed of <span class=\"bold\">260–780 mm/s</span>. ",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">*Linear speed formula: Speed (mm/s) = Stroke × 2 × SPM ÷ 60</span>",
                "These tight, controlled strokes deliver up to <span class=\"bold\">76%</span> more <span class=\"bold\">precision and reduce overreach</span> compared to other reciprocating sanders.",
                "The wobblier the strokes, the more the sanding head drifts—right into places you don’t want it to go.",
                "NeoSander is a different story: its reciprocating linear motor delivers the most direct, controlled strokes no other sander can match. No gears, no rods, <span class=\"bold\">no wandering sanding heads—precision guaranteed.</span>",
                "Most sanders aren’t built for pressure—they stall right away when pushed, low speed makes it worse.",
                "While most traditional sanders jam—gears lock, rods bind—when you push too hard, NeoSander just keeps going. Its adjustable-stroke linear motor ensures <span class=\"bold\">smooth, continuous motion no matter the challenge.</span>",
                "And the vibration doesn’t stop at your grip—it travels into the workpiece, buzzing your other hand. Before long, your hands go numb and precision slips away.",
                "To solve this, NeoSander uses a <span class=\"bold\">counterweight that moves opposite the sanding head</span>, canceling out most vibration and keeping your grip steady, even at full speed.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">No bulky housings blocking your view, no cords pulling you off balance</span>—just a compact tool that fits right in your palm and moves with your hand wherever the detail leads.",
                "Want to level up your sanding even further? <span class=\"bold\">Start with a cleaner cut</span>—because great sanding always begins before you even start sanding.",
                "NeoBlade, a <span class=\"bold\">Wireless Ultrasonic Cutter</span>, delivers <span class=\"bold\">precise, smooth cuts</span> with a blade vibrating at <span class=\"bold\">40,000 times per second</span>—leaving less work for NeoSander and smoother results overall.",
                "NeoSander masters the details. NeoBlock, on the other hand, handles the bigger surfaces.&nbsp;<br><br>When you crave the classic control of a sanding block, NeoBlock delivers—with <span class=\"bold\">quick-swap modular design</span> and <span class=\"bold\">secure belt tension</span>. Together, they cover every sanding need—from fine details to broad strokes.",
                "After the success of NeoBlade, we kept asking ourselves: could the same mechanism work for detail sanding? We tried, we tested… and quickly realized ultrasonic vibration wasn’t the answer.&nbsp;",
                "That challenge sparked a bigger question: how do we build a sanding tool that makers actually need — one that can tackle even the trickiest, tiniest details with ease?",

I am using some rather cheap rotiy tools from amazon and aliexpress for my occational sanding activities with 3D prints and some electronics stuff. The amount of times I slipped with these tools and ruined a print is unreal so I'm really exited for the NeoSander as I expect a similar performance to the NeoBlade and that would be a godsent for me. Therefore I hope the stability and control we can expect from the product is going to be as good as advertised :)",

                "<span class=\"text-italic\">RICKY</span>&nbsp;is the debut feature film from director&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Rashad Frett</span>, winner of the&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">2025 Sundance Directing Award (U.S. Dramatic Competition)</span>.",
                "Based on Frett’s 2023 short film of the same name,&nbsp;<span class=\"text-italic\">RICKY</span>&nbsp;follows a 30-year-old ex-offender navigating life after incarceration. The film stars&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Stephan James</span>&nbsp;(<span class=\"text-italic\">If Beale Street Could Talk</span>),&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Sheryl Lee Ralph</span>&nbsp;(<span class=\"text-italic\">Abbott Elementary</span>), and&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Titus Welliver</span>&nbsp;(<span class=\"text-italic\">Bosch</span>), and premiered at Sundance to strong critical acclaim —&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">89% on Rotten Tomatoes</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">80 on Metacritic</span>.",
                "Rooted in authenticity, humanity, and social realism,&nbsp;<span class=\"text-italic\">RICKY</span>&nbsp;explores themes of redemption, masculinity, systemic inequality, and community.",
                "Following its award-winning Sundance premiere, our team quickly realized that — despite genuine interest from distributors — the marketplace for character-driven dramas and independent films is the most fragile it’s been in years. We were told there was “no market” for stories like this. Rather than accept that, we chose to take control of the film’s future. We believe the safest hands to deliver&nbsp;<span class=\"text-italic\">RICKY</span>&nbsp;to the right audiences — and the right communities — are our own.",
                "This film resonates far beyond incarceration. Whether someone has lived that experience or simply recognizes their own struggle in Ricky’s journey, our goal is to spark real conversations about re-entry, resilience, and the human cost of starting over. At the same time, we want to shine a light on the state of independent filmmaking itself — an art form at risk in today’s industry.",
                "Now is the time to push back.",
                "We’re launching this&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Pay-It-Forward campaign</span>&nbsp;to give the community a voice — to let audiences decide which stories deserve space on the big screen. Through this campaign, you can&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">pre-purchase a ticket</span>&nbsp;for our upcoming theatrical release (venues TBD) or&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">buy a ticket for someone else</span>&nbsp;who might not otherwise have access.",
                "We’re also partnering with&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">youth programs and social-justice organizations</span>&nbsp;focused on prison reform and re-entry support, helping bring&nbsp;<span class=\"text-italic\">RICKY</span>&nbsp;directly to the communities most affected by these issues.",

Regarding the mistakes, I only noticed: a slight decrease in frames / FPS when using evasion / sharp lunge forward; when attacking (if you click attack + stop clicking + start clicking attack again), the attack may take place without sound (not hitting the enemy). I hope you'll understand me correctly (if it's translated well)",

With no money and even less respect, Corsica was forced to put her skills to use as a second-rate private investigator.

We delivered on that promise, with every single Naya Create unit shipped, and validated something important: modular input works. People want their hands to stay on the keyboard. They want precision tools at home row. They want to stop breaking flow.",

Since day one you asked us to give you our modules standalone: Finally, the universal <span class=\"bold\">Naya</span> <span class=\"bold\">Dock</span> for all of our modules! Combined with a familiar, low-profile, customizable and premium build mechanical keyboard: <span class=\"bold\">Naya Type.</span> And an ecosystem of snap-on Attachments: <span class=\"bold\">Naya</span> <span class=\"bold\">Multipad and Naya 6-Key</span>.",

Cables are there, as we got half a product: only the hardware and zero software, with the impossibility to see charge levels or modules, configure Bluetooth, or even more, configure the keyboard! (Windows and Mac users have reported Bluetooth issues and long response times too).  As you can see, there is also and \"extra\" trackball as the one included with Naya Connect just discharged and the only automatic answer I got when I asked for support was that they will come back to me. Weeks passed and nothing, community support is better that the delayed and some times non-existent company one, and the Naya Tech doesn't even release a single line of documentation so, more tech savvy users can rely on external open source software to configure our keyboards (as I did here: https://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/copycat/file?name=.config/kanata.kbd )  ",

                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over 30 years ago the PlayStation 1 forever changed the world of video games. As the first mainstream 3D console — a machine of endless possibilities — it left a lasting mark on an entire generation of players, creators, and dreamers of virtual worlds.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Born from that very passion, the <span class=\"text-italic\">PlayStation Anthology</span> tetralogy stands as an exhaustive, well-documented, and heartfelt tribute to the history of a console that transformed not only the video game industry but also the way it is perceived.&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">This limited &amp; numbered 4-volume box set edition of over 1,300 pages includes:</span>",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This first 460-page volume is a reissue of the <span class=\"text-italic\">PlayStation Anthology – Collector’s Edition</span>, originally published in 2018. It includes 6 Chapters, including:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How did we get here? How could a company as experienced and pragmatic as Sony allow itself to be drawn into such a risky venture? Neither mockery nor criticism was enough to stop it. On June 24, 1992, the former president of Sony Corporation, Norio Ohga, took the subsidiary’s future into his own hands. Without any internal consensus, he gave Ken Kutaragi full freedom to pursue his “precious little project.” The bewilderment of Ohga's staff did nothing to dissuade him. Sony was to enter the great race of video games, standing alongside the established giants of the industry, despite having no experience in the field and facing already fierce competition.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a decision that would have enormous consequences and ultimately shape the course of video game history. Ohga’s choice remains one of the boldest moves Sony ever made. And in many ways, it reflects a way of thinking that can be traced back through Sony’s history, all the way to its origins. This chapter includes:&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thirty years now separate us from the very first commercial release of the PlayStation. Far from any mercantile or commercial considerations, these three decades have allowed hearts to open, voices to loosen, and memories to resurface.&nbsp;Under such conditions, it becomes not only interesting, but truly exhilarating, for anyone passionate about the subject to speak with the people who, in one way or another, contributed to what would become the greatest success in the entire industry. Across the four corners of the world, we went to meet twenty-six of these individuals who, through their creativity, their emotion, their determination — in short, through their passion — helped shape a part of our lives: our lives as players.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The PlayStation’s swift rise to glory was possible due to its rich game library; supported by the unparalleled capabilities of its hardware. The shockwave it created at launch brought together some of the most talented creators, developers, animators, graphic designers, and musicians, all rallying behind the Sony cause. The Hardware chapter includes:&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A trailblazer through and through, the PlayStation 1 set its own trends in gameplay, technology, and even gamer mentality. One particular movement it helped fuel was that of collecting, which expanded dramatically with the rise of 32-bit consoles. In the early 1990s, the West had not yet warmed up to the idea, especially in Europe. There was little available beyond a few Super Nintendo and Mega Drive/Genesis bundles that included a peripheral with the game. Collecting remained the domain of a niche group of connoisseurs. Publishers were therefore unwilling to take risks with such ambitious products, which would have further increased the already high price of their games. It was Sony — the outsider — to step in before publishers began taking these kinds of initiatives, and before video games as a whole would finally gain the support and recognition of a broader, more open audience. This 70-page chapter includes more than 250 special editions sorted by year, and every PlayStation 1 limited edition.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every console has had its fair share of unreleased and cancelled titles: some highly anticipated, others completely forgettable. With the commercial success of the PlayStation 1 across the globe — over one hundred million units sold — the environment for developers and publishers around the year 2000 was such that even some truly terrible games still managed to reach the market. However, due to financial instability and issues related to exploitation rights, more than a hundred titles were developed and produced only to be abandoned before launch day. In this chapter of the <span class=\"text-italic\">PlayStation Anthology</span>, it feels only fitting that we take a moment to acknowledge the games that fell through the cracks.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A definitive reference work, the <span class=\"text-italic\">PlayStation Collector’s Guide</span> meticulously lists every title released for Sony’s console across all regions. Designed for both dedicated collectors and enthusiasts of video game history, it stands as an essential resource for understanding, cataloging, and preserving this unique legacy.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Note:</span> If you already own the <span class=\"text-italic\">PlayStation Anthology – Collector’s Edition</span>, purchasing this first volume is not necessary. Your existing copy fits perfectly into the <span class=\"text-italic\">Collector’s Box Set</span> alongside the three other volumes (reward: <span class=\"bold\">PS Anthology Vol.2, 3, 4 + Box Set)</span>",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spanning more than 750 pages and covering over<span class=\"bold\"> 4,130 unique titles</span>, these two volumes immerse the reader in the remarkable diversity of the PlayStation catalog — from little-known RPGs and legendary shoot’em ups to cult curiosities and regional exclusives. Together, they form a genuine map of the global PlayStation industry.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The collection compiles reviews of every officially released PlayStation game in Japan, North America, and Europe between 1994 and 2006. Each entry lists the alternative titles used across regions (for example, <span class=\"text-italic\">Bust-A-Move ’99</span> in North America, retitled <span class=\"text-italic\">Bust-A-Move 3 DX</span> in PAL territories and <span class=\"text-italic\">Puzzle Bobble 3 DX</span> in Japan), along with the publisher, developer, number of CDs, and release dates for each of the three markets. Titles are organized by year, with each section introduced by an analytical overview that highlights the trends and evolution of the PlayStation market over time.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A symbol of an entire generation, the PlayStation 1 made history not only through its games but also through the distinctive visual identity of its cover art. This fourth volume aims to highlight the graphic contrasts between the Japanese, American, and European editions.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From one continent to another, the image representing the same game could change dramatically: a poetic illustration in Japan might become an explosive action scene in the United States, while Europe often struck a balance between the two. These variations reflect the aesthetic, cultural, and marketing choices unique to each market, telling in their own way the global story of the PlayStation.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Together, they form a gallery of visual interpretations — a reflection of a time when cover art played a decisive role in how a game was perceived. More than just a catalog, this fourth volume stands as both a visual archive and a work of memory, celebrating the boundless creativity of Sony’s first console and the diversity of the imaginations it inspired.",
                "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through these covers, an entire facet of PlayStation culture emerges: a dialogue between art, marketing, and video games; a testament to an era when every box, every image, told a story.&nbsp;",

                "<span class=\"bold\">For the first time, experience the untold story of Donn Beach, the founder of Tiki pop culture, through his personal archives.</span>",
                "Donn Beach, born Ernest Raymond Gantt, was the visionary creator of the world’s first tiki bar and the legendary rum cocktail culture that thrives today. Starting modestly in a tiny Hollywood speakeasy during Prohibition, he crafted complex, flavourful drinks like the Zombie and Navy Grog. By combining fresh juices, secret ingredients, and theatrical presentation, Donn invented the very ritual of tropical escapism. His innovations transcended cocktails, shaping themed dining and immersive environments that brought an idealised Polynesian culture to an America captivated by exoticism. He collaborated closely with Filipino bartenders and a supportive circle of friends to expand his empire to Chicago and, later, Hawaii’s Waikiki.",
                "Behind this empire lay a life of authentic cinematic adventure. Born in a tiny west Texas town, he circled the globe twice before he was twenty during the 1920s. He would later become a host and friend to the elite of Hollywood’s Golden Age. His early years as a bootlegger entangled him with the mob, from whose grasp he would struggle for years to break free. Answering the call of duty in World War II, he earned both a Purple Heart for his wounds and a Bronze Star for his exceptional service to airmen—and to figures like Churchill and Eisenhower. He gained and lost fortunes, repeatedly reinventing himself by launching ventures around the globe so iconic they have become the stuff of legend.",
                "Despite personal and business upheavals—including a challenging divorce and rumoured mob alliances—Donn remained the charismatic host and cultural ambassador of his own creation until his death in 1989. His ambitious projects stood as testaments to his vision. Today, his influence endures worldwide in tiki bars, craft cocktail revivals, and the continued celebration of island-inspired hospitality.",
                "Author and historian Tim “Swanky” Glazner has been granted exclusive access to Donn Beach’s personal archives—including never-before-seen photographs, business memos, personal letters, ephemera, and cocktail recipes.",
                "This definitive, 208-page hardback volume will:",
                "“Donn Beach single-handedly invented the Tiki bar and the Tiki drink, but his legacy dimmed over the years because unlike Trader Vic he never published his recipes or his autobiography. This book rights that wrong with heretofore unseen gems from Beach's personal archive, from photographs to business memos to personal letters. A must for every Tikiphile's reference library.” — <span class=\"bold\">Jeff “Beachbum” Berry</span>",
                "“Although Donn Beach conceived one of the most successful ‘tropical escapism’ brands in 20th-century hospitality, the man behind this romantic persona remained an enigma—surrounded by rumors as closely guarded as the recipes for his iconic cocktails. Donn’s own life was as extraordinary as any fiction, and it is finally revealed in detail within this fascinating, long-awaited book.” —<span class=\"bold\"> Sven Kirsten, &nbsp;</span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">The Book of Tiki</span></span>",
                "“This tome is the closest we’ll ever get to sitting down with the man who created the escapist pop culture phenomenon known as 'Tiki'. Get to know that man, Donn Beach, the man that gave us tropical escapism, filled with rummy cocktails and flotsam and jetsam, still enjoyed today. So pull up a barstool,&nbsp;feast your eyes on some tasty eye candy,&nbsp;and read the story of the real man who created 'Tiki' out of the darkness of Prohibition.” — <span class=\"bold\">Marie King, Beverage Director, Don the Beachcomber</span>",

                "A large version of one of these cannibals was created exclusively for Donn.<br>That special carving first appears after the war in 1946 at his Encino home. When he pulled up stakes and moved to Hawaii to start over, the “mascot” cannibal traveled with him.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">ANTS &amp; CRUMBLES</span> started as a simple idea on a kitchen towel and evolved into our favorite game to play. Because we love this game so much, we created a special edition just for this Kickstarter. This exclusive version features a large holographic box, premium oversized components and Kickstarter only content.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">The main game will be in English 🇬🇧. Online rulebooks will be available in German 🇩🇪, French 🇫🇷, Spanish 🇪🇸, Dutch 🇳🇱, and other requested languages.&nbsp;</span>",
                "In Ants &amp; Crumbles there are multiple ways to win. Before diving into this Kickstarter, here is a quick overview of the game’s objectives.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">In ANTS &amp; CRUMBLES: WAR AT THE PICNIC TABLE</span>, players take on the role of rival ant colonies, each marching across the picnic table in search of food and dominance",
                "Watch our How to Play video below to see the game in action and learn the rules in minutes.",
                "<br><span class=\"bold\">Want to see how a full game unfolds?</span><br>We’ve also recorded a uncut <span class=\"bold\">complete playthrough</span>, showing real turns, tactics, and lively player interaction as the picnic table fills up. It’s perfect if you want a deeper feel for the flow, tension, and decision-making in <span class=\"text-italic\">Ants &amp; Crumbles</span>.",
                "<br>A big thank you to <span class=\"bold\">Het Spelletjeskoppel</span> for playing <span class=\"text-italic\">Ants &amp; Crumbles</span> and sharing an online review! We’re genuinely proud of their feedback, and even more proud of the amazing score they gave us: a 9!",

                "We’ve created two expansions that build on <span class=\"bold\">ANTS &amp; CRUMBLES</span> in very different ways. One reimagines the battlefield, changing how the game feels from the ground up. The other layers seamlessly onto both versions, adding new risks and rewards without altering the core rules.<br><br>Together, they offer two different ways to expand the game, depending on how you want to play.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Battle in the Beehive</span> is built on the same core gameplay as <span class=\"text-italic\">Ants &amp; Crumbles</span>, but the experience feels entirely different. With its new board and object system, it plays like a complete game in its own right rather than a simple expansion.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">A Table Full of Perks &amp; Hazards</span> introduces a fresh layer of Perk and Hazard effects that sit on top of the existing gameplay. Designed to work seamlessly with both the Base Game and the Expansion, without changing the core rules.<br><br>Candy Tokens are dropped onto the board, tempting your ants with a sweet sugar boost they simply can’t resist. But every treat comes with a risk: these tokens can trigger powerful perks <span class=\"text-italic\">or</span> nasty hazards.",
                "If you’d like to dive deeper into how <span class=\"bold\">Ants &amp; Crumbles</span> plays, you can find the <span class=\"bold\">full rulebook</span> for the main game, <span class=\"bold\">Ants &amp; Crumbles: War at the Picnic Table,</span> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_KE8DHb-eZqTj4GCo5Ne3LT_9fgyLSi/view?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We want ANTS &amp; CRUMBLES to be the best possible game from day one.</span><br>Therefore, we decided not to keep gameplay elements or upgrades behind stretch goals. From the start, the game includes a premium box, a custom insert, and the complete gameplay experience, NO compromises.",
                "That doesn’t mean we won’t celebrate success. If this campaign goes big, we’ve prepared 2 very special milestones!",
                "We aim to move as quickly as possible while keeping production and fulfillment reliable and well controlled. This timeline is intentionally conservative to manage expectations and avoid disappointment.",
                "We have solid experience producing and fulfilling board games and we work with trusted manufacturing and fulfillment partners we know well. Based on that experience, we do not anticipate any issues in production or delivery.",
                "If we’re able to move faster at any stage, we’ll communicate updates clearly and make sure that momentum directly benefits our backers.",

                "The game started on a kitchen towel and evolved into <span class=\"bold\">Ants &amp; Crumbles: War at the Picnic Table</span>. We’ve poured our hearts into every detail, and we truly hope you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it.<br><br>Your support means the world to us and helps bring this game to tables around the globe. Thank you for backing our project.",
                "Our goal is simple: to take the best possible care of our backers. We’ll do everything we can to ship rewards reliably, quickly, and at the lowest possible cost.",
                "This is not our first Kickstarter. We have successfully fulfilled previous campaigns and we already handle worldwide fulfillment daily through our own webshop. We’re very familiar with international shipping, customs, and last mile delivery, and we’ll apply that experience fully to this project.",
                "Our regular games are more compact, but even with the larger Kickstarter editions we’ll optimize packaging, routes, and fulfillment partners to keep costs down.",
                "Once final quantities are confirmed, we’ll actively negotiate better shipping rates with our fulfillment and logistics partners. Any savings we achieve will, of course, be passed on to our backers.",
                "To avoid any disappointment, we recommend assuming the higher end of the estimates below. If shipping ends up cheaper, you’ll benefit directly.",
                "Based on our current estimates:<br>• Pledge 1 will cost approximately €20–30 to ship to the US and EU<br>• Regions outside the US and EU will be around €10 higher<br>• Pledge 2 is expected to be €5–15 more expensive than Pledge 1 due to increased size and weight",
                "If you order multiple pledges, shipping costs will be lower per item. We will fully optimize this in the pledge manager to make sure combined shipping is applied correctly.",
                "These are realistic estimates based on our existing fulfillment experience and current carrier rates. We’ll continue refining everything to make sure your reward arrives smoothly and without unnecessary costs.",

Does this price also include any taxes you pay for the EU or will that be added on top of this? I find the shipping costs quite high, especially in comparison to other kickstarter projects of board games that are from Europe (such as the Netherlands and Germany), that ship for a much lower price (and often offer a cheaper shipping fee for backers that are based in the same country as the product is shipped from). I have backed for now, but the additional shipping costs make the game quite pricy, so I'm not 100% sure if it will stay like that.",

ANYWHERE. Each can delivers <span class=\"bold\">countless quick touch-ups</span> for a showroom shine, plus <span class=\"bold\">2–3 full exterior, heavy-duty cleans</span> for complete vehicle coverage - and is highly effective on <span class=\"bold\">bird droppings, tree sap, and more</span>.",
                "After our successful first Kickstarter campaign in 2023 - raising over <span class=\"bold\">$500,000 </span>including post-campaign rewards - we delivered our products to thousands of backers and grew Rubbit into a fast-scaling brand, serving <span class=\"bold\">over 100,000 satisfied customers </span>across 2024–2025 with our waterless car wash kits. By gathering feedback from customers using our proprietary Foam Formula and Foam Sprayer, we found ways to make the experience even faster, easier, and more affordable.",
                "Now, <span class=\"bold\">we’re excited to introduce Rubbit’s Car Wash In A Can™</span> - powered by our proven Foam Formula and a more advanced, simplified application system for effortless, mess-free cleaning in minutes.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We are Raz &amp; Shaked</span>, two pilots turned entrepreneurs, alongside an amazing team: <span class=\"bold\">Hart, </span>our VP of Marketing, <span class=\"bold\">Vikash</span>, our VP of Product &amp; Operations, and many more talented people. At the beginning of our journey, we recognized a problem in keeping small planes and helicopters clean safely and efficiently. Conventional water-pressure methods posed several challenges: they weren’t always available, and they created puddles in hangars that risked damaging the aircrafts’ electrical components.<br>We embarked on extensive research with chemists and a leading detergent factory, which led us to develop a revolutionary cleaning formula that, when applied with pressure, turns into a foam that absorbs dirt from the surface of the aircraft and can then be wiped away without rinsing. This was clearly a great solution for vehicles as well, so we gave it a try - and immediately realized its potential.<br>After succeeding with our car wash kits globally, serving over 100,000 customers in the past year, and following a very successful Kickstarter campaign, we decided to listen to our customers and take things one step further. The result is an even easier, faster, and more affordable solution - <span class=\"bold\">The Car Wash In A Can™.&nbsp;</span>",
                "A bit part of this Kickstarter campaign is to help us build our own production line and <span class=\"bold\">commit to mass production on U.S. soil!&nbsp;</span>",
                "<br>The shipping rate will be provided after the campaign. Shipping within the U.S. is estimated at approximately $5–$8, depending on the size of the order and delivery location. You’ll be charged for shipping in the post-campaign survey. Please note that the item’s price does not include additional duties and taxes that may be applicable based on your local importation laws.<br>Return Policy: Kickstarter is a platform that enables innovators to offer their creations and ideas at discounted prices.

If you’re referring to placing the Brewing Core on a stand with a larger cup underneath and brewing two separate batches by adding water and coffee twice, with a quick rinse of the centrifugal chamber in between, there’s no need to 3D print an additional adapter. Our Home &amp; Go Pack already includes a Stable Brewing Stand designed specifically for this setup, allowing you to brew two consecutive 12oz batches directly into the same larger cup, such as a 24oz cold brew."

While each brew cycle is optimized for 12oz to maintain our recommended water-to-coffee ratio, you can absolutely brew a larger total volume by running Ecoldbrew on the brewing stand twice and brewing directly into a larger cup or carafe. This approach allows you to scale up your drink while preserving the same bold, full-bodied flavor profile from each individual brew."

Previously, we explored how color makes us feel through celebrations, traditions, and culture, like Holi in India and Mardi Gras in New Orleans; how we see color underwater in Australia at the Great Barrier Reef; color in food and spices, including the extraordinary one-color red sand between the Sahara Desert and Marrakech, Morocco; and the Northern Lights in Alaska.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">COLOR in Nature</span> is a culmination of my lifelong passion for nature, exploration, and storytelling. Ever since I was a child, I've been enamored with the natural world, spending countless nights glued to the Discovery Channel, particularly captivated by shows like \"Wild Discovery.\" This love for nature even led me to consider a career as a marine biologist at one point. During the filming of <span class=\"bold\">COLOR</span>, I felt like I was living out a childhood dream, channeling the spirit of iconic naturalists like Steve Irwin or David Attenborough. Whether it was diving in the Great Barrier Reef, traversing the Sahara Desert, or witnessing the Northern Lights in Alaska, each moment was a testament to the wonder and beauty of our planet.",
                "In 2023, my journey took a deeper perspective during an ayahuasca retreat, which heightened my awareness of my connection to nature and the universe. This newfound perspective has fueled my desire to delve even further into the mysteries of the natural world through <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">COLOR in Nature</span></span>. Living in New York City has undoubtedly created a sense of disconnect from nature, despite the presence of places like Central Park. Through this documentary, I aim to reconnect with the essence of nature and explore its vibrant colors in diverse landscapes. These include the glaciers of Iceland; the Rainbow Mountains of Cusco, Peru; the jungles of Hang Pygmy, Vietnam; the Mona Monkeys and Dye Pits of Nigeria; and the butterfly sanctuaries of Piedra Herrada, Mexico — all paired with an \"insightful\" conversation about how we actually see <span class=\"bold\">COLOR</span>.",
                "Inspired by this entire experience, all caught on camera, I was later inspired to make work that connects to each location, celebrating and closing an unforgettable journey into nature.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">COLOR in Nature</span> is not just about exploration; it's about rediscovering our place within the intricate web of life on Earth. As an artist explorer, I see it as my calling to seek out these foreign yet inherently natural patterns that exist in the world, sharing their beauty and significance with others. This moment in my life feels ripe for such an adventure, and I'm eager to embark on this journey of discovery.",

This campaign is for the new edition of award-winning French TTRPG <span class=\"text-italic\">Donjon &amp; Cie</span> (2022), remastered and augmented by the Merry Mushmen with its original author, Ben Felten.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> the game is about monsters working for Dungeon, Inc., a corporate organisation secretly running the largest megadungeon in the land. The players are Reception hosts, tasked with solving ‘client issues’, mostly adventurers refusing to die. They are employed by the company secretly operating inside the most famous dungeon in all the land. Each mission sends the hosts into a dungeon level, generally to 'deal' with clients. The organization relies on looting adventurers for income, but some must escape with enough loot to spread the Dungeon’s legend and attract more clients. Of course, no one can ever know that the Dungeon is a deadly tourist trap!<br>Missions are followed by a downtime period where players get to have an office life. They relax, spend their little disposable income (or the loot they ‘forgot’ to hand over), pursue friendships and romantic aspirations, and perhaps investigate the dark deals and inhumane machinations of upper management.<br>A typical <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> campaign starts with a simple mission, but as the hosts gain experience, they become involved in lethal office politics and magic power struggles that lead them to discover some of the company’s many secrets. What starts as a dungeon of the week episodic series can end up in an epic saga where more than mere survival is at stake! The characters may even have to venture in the Bright Outside, the dreaded world of the surface where danger is everywhere (at least that’s what the company keeps saying).",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> is a 128-page hardback, A5 book (close to digest-size). It contains everything you need for a complete campaign: rules for character creation, fast and battlemap-free combat, powerful but life-draining magic, and everything else you would expect from a fantasy game. The company’s structure and organization are explained in enough detail to help the DM (Discussion Moderator, we know that other term is trademarked!) and players fill in the blanks. Many random tables will help them flesh out clients (adventurers), colleagues (monsters), dungeon denizens (also monsters), office rumors and interactions, mission complications, and much more. Chapters devoted to mission creation and campaign modes assist planner DMs as well as the seat-of-your-pants improv types.<br>The Mission Booklet is a 72-page softcover A5 book. It contains no less than 10 missions for all seniority ranks (as we call experience levels), from the simple ‘find the invisible halfling’ job to the company-shattering clusterfuck that will require masterful politicking to just survive.",
                "At Mushmen Tower, we don’t believe in tomes full of histories, room-by-room inventories, and long lists of NPCs. This is one of the things we love about the original <span class=\"text-italic\">Donjon &amp; Cie</span>. Ben came up with just the right amount of material to start a campaign. At character creation, the table comes up with a handful of NPCs: the team’s close collaborators, as well as their best frenemy – the employee of the month – and give every character a relationship with them. From there, the DM can rely on easy-to-use descriptions for each Department and Section of the Dungeon to flesh out relationships, create situations, and roll up the NPCs they need. They will of course be able to build on the 10 adventures from the Mission Booklet to start their campaign.&nbsp;",
                "These books aren’t filled with self-referential jokes. At its core, the game is a rather gritty dungeon delver with twists – how many dungeons have you explored with a map that marks all the traps… Wait, was this map updated after the renovations? Anyway, we promise you will laugh a lot playing <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc</span>. But the humour derives from the game’s proposition – delving a dangerous dungeon as underpaid troubleshooters. This alone makes a lot of things funny in their absurdity. Situations that are difficult, annoying, or even deadly for characters become hilarious to us players. Like any good parody, <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> builds on clichés and genre twists to create a loving homage to the original roleplaying game and dungeon-delving fantasy. It is a great game for the episodic one-shot, but after a few sessions everyone will want to know more about their colleagues, managers, and whatever threat was hinted at during the last mission.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> is built onto <span class=\"text-italic\">Macchiato Monsters</span>, itself a hack of OSR powerhouses <span class=\"text-italic\">Whitehack</span> and <span class=\"text-italic\">The Black Hack</span> (both homages to the classic editions of D&amp;D). To get technical, it is a streamlined <span class=\"bold\">d20 roll-under system</span> that takes advantage of the risk die mechanic (derived from TBH’s usage die) to abstract resources and handle threats in a fun way. From <span class=\"text-italic\">Whitehack</span>, it borrows the freeform nature of magic and expands its classless open character creation. In <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> <span class=\"bold\">you can play any monster</span> you want, with any combination of special abilities. You even get to come up with your own spells! As most old-school inspired games<span class=\"text-italic\">, Dungeon, Inc.</span> is for players who enjoy a challenge. Reception hosts are often in over their heads: not only do they have to defeat seasoned adventurers who slay ogres for breakfast, but they must avoid traps, manage dungeon denizens, and other mission surprises while keeping the existence of the company a secret. Bloodthirsty hack-and-slashers will enjoy short careers while out-of-the box thinkers are the one who will get to retire. Maybe. One day... if they can stay clear of their Termination colleagues.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> was years in the making (plus another handful of years of development for this current version) and it is the product of many influences, but pop culture touchstones include: Bullfrog’s video game <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon Keeper</span>, Sfar &amp; Trondheim’s long-running graphic novel series <span class=\"text-italic\">Donjon</span>, the TV show <span class=\"text-italic\">The Office</span>, the masterful manga <span class=\"text-italic\">Delicious in Dungeon</span> by Kui Ryōko, the classic Pixar movie <span class=\"text-italic\">Monsters, Inc.</span>, and &nbsp;the TTRPG <span class=\"text-italic\">Paranoia</span> by West End Games.",
                "For years, the Old-School Renaissance movement has attracted enthusiasts of all ages with its rulings-over-rules philosophy and open-world adventures. But giving total freedom to a group of TTRPG nerds is intimidating. With its mission-based framework, <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc.</span> is ideal for the group who wants to dip a toe in the rewarding waters of the OSR before jumping headfirst. As the DM, you decide which mission to drop on your players, watch them make a mess in this closed environment, and let them roam freely in the office sandbox, where they will find allies and make enemies. You and your friends can progressively learn to handle a rules-light, freedom heavy TTRPG, and before you know it, everyone will be ready to overthrow Mr. Noir, the enigmatic Overseer-in-Chief and funder of <span class=\"text-italic\">Dungeon, Inc</span>.",
                "Overt two years ago (yeah, that's how long we've been working on this game), we made a quickstart zine containing a summary of the rules and a 'first job'adventure, along with five pregenerated Reception hosts. Some minor rules changes have occured since then, and the layout its completely different, but if you're curious, you can <a href=\"https://www.themerrymushmen.com/ressources-tmm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">download it from the ressources page of the TMM website</a>.&nbsp;",
                "We are handling fulfilment directly ourselves from France as we can take advantage of the subsidised letter rates for books. We get tracking numbers but these aren’t communicated digitally, so we will not be able to automatically share your tracking numbers to you. <span class=\"bold\">For the USA</span>, we work with a trusted partner who takes care of fulfilment from the East Coast, which explains the different shipping fee for Unites States addresses.",
                "We’re a boutique RPG publisher with very artisanal inner workings. There is no time or brainpower for complicated crowdfunding campaigns including boxes, dice, cloth maps, and the like. Don’t get us wrong, we love buying all the shiny things from more adept crews than ours. We also don’t like promising extra content to create hype. These things take time to do, delay us when something goes south, while all we want is make the next cool book. So we stick to making books. The good news is, we are done with the game, so we will be able to fulfil the digital books right after the campaign ends.",

                "In the first part, you’ll meet a young, rebellious she-devil named Grace — the daughter of Satan himself. Bored with the monotony of Hell, Grace is infamous for her defiant and often erotic antics, which throw the underworld into chaos and push her father’s patience to the limit. Although Satan has big, ambitious plans for her, Grace follows her own desires, which don’t align with Hell’s strict rules.",
                "When she’s punished by being sent to Heaven, Grace makes a bold decision to escape to Earth. There, she transforms into a beautiful, seductive woman and begins a life full of erotic adventures in the human world. Alongside her is Death — a small, sarcastic demoness who watches Grace’s wild ideas unfold with growing dread and does her best to keep them in check.",
                "In the second part of this extraordinary comic book series, Grace dives even deeper into the world of humans — and their temptations. The red-haired daughter of Satan explores the pleasures of the flesh, growing closer to a young waitress named Klara, with whom she uncovers the sensual secrets of earthly life.",
                "Hot on her trail are three rather dim-witted hunters, sent by Satan himself. The very same ones Grace shamelessly manipulated in the first part for her own wicked plans — convincing them that erotic toys were modern torture devices. Now they must face the harsh reality of life on Earth, which turns out to be far more brutal than the deepest pits of Hell.",
                "At the start, we follow <span class=\"bold\">Grace and Klara</span>, who dive deeper into the world of desire and pleasure. Klara – once shy and uncertain – is being transformed under Grace’s fiery guidance into a woman fully aware of her power and lusts.&nbsp;",
                "Their relationship grows bolder, filled with dominance, playful provocations, and raw passion. Always at their side is <span class=\"bold\">Death</span>, the sarcastic miniature reaper, whose biting remarks balance the tension with sharp, irreverent humor.",
                "But the story soon escalates. In Hell, fury is brewing – Satan has discovered that Grace slipped from his grasp and now demands her return. Unaware of the betrayal secretly being plotted against him by Mammon and his father Behemoth, Satan unleashes Mammon – the son of Behemoth, a demon of greed and manipulation who bends human desires as easily as he once bent global financial markets. His mission is clear: to capture Grace and drag her back to Hell.",
                "On Earth, it is Little Death who first stumbles upon Mammon by chance. Usually carefree and mischievous, this time she froze in terror – for she recognized in the newcomer none other than the son of Behemoth.

                "Hi, I’m Mila Young, a USA Today Bestselling Author who writes dark, steamy stories with fierce heroines, broody monsters, and wild twists. By day, I work in marketing, but by night, I dive into fantasy worlds filled with magic, danger, and powerful women who don’t wait to be rescued—they take charge.",
                "<br><br>I’ve always been drawn to fairytales, but the darker the better. Give me a cursed forest, a masked villain, or a morally grey monster, and I’ll show you a heroine who will rise to meet him. My stories often begin with a “what if”—what if Red Riding Hood was the predator? What if the monster under the bed wanted to protect you, not kill you? That spark of curiosity is usually all it takes before the characters take over.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;",
                "<br>This series in particular was born out of my love for flipping tropes and creating heroines who rewrite the rules. I write for readers who crave emotional intensity, high heat, and a little bit of chaos in their romance. If that’s you, you’re in the right place.",
                "I’ve been publishing for over a decade, and I’ve been producing special editions for years through my online store and physical retail partners.

                "<span class=\"bold\">Art is a mirror</span>. It reflects not only ourselves, but the world around us—allowing us to more clearly see our place within it. <span class=\"bold\">The greatest artworks reward deep examination</span>. Our engagement with that art rewards us with a<span class=\"bold\"> deeper insight</span> into who we are, providing a roadmap to navigate the ever-changing landscapes of the world we inhabit.",
                "In the late 19th century, electricity, bicycles, and countless other technologies we now take for granted were <span class=\"bold\">radical innovations</span>. For the first time, telescopes and microscopes entered private homes, opening minds to realms beyond our immediate vision and <span class=\"bold\">expanding human perception</span> in unprecedented ways. A<span class=\"bold\"> revolutionary artistic movement </span>emerged in this era, attempting to <span class=\"bold\">bridge the gap</span> between the <span class=\"bold\">old world and the new </span>with flowing vines entwining humanity with machinery; a reminder, at a pivotal moment in history, of our connection with Nature and each other, a poetic labor to build a bridge between the things we knew and the things we imagined possible: <span class=\"bold\">Art Nouveau.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Alphonse Mucha</span> considered <span class=\"text-italic\">The Lord's Prayer</span> the greatest poem ever written, and his metaphysical interpretation of the text was <span class=\"bold\">unlike anything the world had seen before</span>. The artist, exhausted by commercial success, demanded that his most important work be produced in only 510 copies and then had the plates completely destroyed. This visionary artwork was Mucha’s <span class=\"bold\">love letter to humanity</span>- and while it was often spoken of, it remained hidden for a century, with only esoteric book collectors and academics intimate with its contents.&nbsp;",
                "In 2019, we released the first edition of Thomas Negovan's detailed analysis of the history which informed the work and reproduced Mucha's artworks nearly to full scale, a massive 16\" tall tome. The next edition was revised and expanded with a section devoted to Le Pater's censorship by the church, published only as a 9\" x 12\" paperback.",
                "The new edition is the expanded text, revised and presented in the original massive 12\" x 16\" hardcover scale.",
                "For over a century, the mystical symbols embedded within <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span> were dismissed as imagination. <span class=\"bold\">Fortunately, where art academia fails, occult academia rewards.</span>",
                "Over the course of twenty-five years, author <span class=\"bold\">Thomas Negovan</span> traced the esoteric roots of <span class=\"text-italic\">Le Pater</span>—decoding its hidden messages, spiritual symbolism, and forgotten history. His findings were revealed in a groundbreaking book, <span class=\"bold\">the most innovative study of Art Nouveau in decades</span>.",

                "Thanks to the Kickstarter community, in May of 2025 we successfully funded our <span class=\"bold\">79th Kickstarter campaign</span>, a <span class=\"bold\">deluxe edition </span>of our sold-out fine art book exploring the<span class=\"bold\"> lost Art Nouveau masterpiece </span>of<span class=\"bold\"> Alphonse Mucha</span>.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">April 2026 book release</span> is fast approaching, and we're marking the occasion with a final opportunity to get the book at a <span class=\"bold\">special discount price</span>, and a<span class=\"bold\"> meditation coin</span> featuring Alphonse Mucha's 1899 <span class=\"bold\">flowering hammer sigil</span>—a symbol of human <span class=\"bold\">will made manifest</span>, illustrating our ability to <span class=\"bold\">shape our destiny</span> through <span class=\"bold\">conscious action</span>.",

                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is releasing their second album: a collection of violin and piano arrangements celebrating some of the most iconic Studio Ghibli scores ever written.",
                "Matthew Castle and Luke Vergobi previously collaborated on Matthew’s album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span>, which charted at number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. That experience affirmed something they had already felt for years while making music together: this partnership deserved its own name, its own sound, and its own future. This new album marks the first official release under the duo name Castle &amp; Vergobi.",
                "This project features music from Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo, Princess Mononoke, and The Boy and the Heron. Twelve sweeping tracks, each lovingly arranged for violin and piano, reimagining the melodies that defined entire childhoods and continue to move audiences around the world.",
                "Every piece on this album was originally composed by the incomparable Joe Hisaishi, whose longtime collaboration with director Hayao Miyazaki shaped the emotional heartbeat of Studio Ghibli. His music is wonder, tenderness, adventure, melancholy, and hope all at once. This album is our way of honoring that legacy while offering something new and intimate through the voice of violin and piano.",
                "Over the past year, we have been arranging, rehearsing, refining, and dreaming about this record. Now we are ready to bring it into a professional studio and turn it into something truly special.",
                "Your support will help fund the studio space, sound engineers, production, mixing, and mastering needed to create an album that does justice to this extraordinary music.",
                "Castle &amp; Vergobi is the classical duo formed by Matthew Castle on violin and Luke Vergobi on piano.",
                "Matthew is a professional violinist and recording artist whose album <span class=\"text-italic\">Classical Encore</span> reached number eight on the Billboard Classical charts in November 2024. Luke has been playing piano since he was seven years old and studied music at the University of Washington. He brings a lifelong dedication to his craft and a deep sensitivity as a collaborator and arranger.",
                "For the past year, this project has lived in our living room, our home studio, and our daily routines. These arrangements were not rushed. They were built slowly, with care, curiosity, and a deep love for the worlds these melodies come from. Each track has been shaped to highlight the warmth of the violin, the emotional range of the piano, and the cinematic quality that makes this music so enduring.",
                "This is not just another album for us. It is a personal artistic statement and the beginning of Castle &amp; Vergobi as a duo.",
                "Backing this campaign means helping two independent classical musicians create an album with the resources it deserves.",
                "Studio Ghibli’s music is deeply emotional and technically demanding. Capturing it properly requires a professional recording space, experienced engineers, and thoughtful production. Your support directly enables us to step into that space and work with the people who can help bring out every breath, bow stroke, and nuance in these performances.",

                "So we began reimagining. We asked:<br><span class=\"bold\">What if health products were calming to use?</span><br><span class=\"bold\">What if they looked like part of your home, not something to hide away?</span><br><span class=\"bold\">What if they carried goodness in every detail?</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">modobloom is our answer</span> — a product built to make wellness feel natural, human, and beautiful.",
                "And this is bigger than one product. It's about leaving a <span class=\"bold\">healthier legacy</span> — for today and for the future.",
                "This is why we do what we do. And it's why we want you to be part of this mission. By joining us now, you're not just backing a product. You're helping shape a future where wellness is <span class=\"bold\">simple, consistent, and dignified for everyone</span>.",
                "At modobloom, we craft every product with care and lasting quality. We offer a 1-year warranty, covering any issues caused by manufacturing errors or product defects. Our goal is to ensure a reliable, worry-free experience — your comfort and trust are our constant commitment.",
                "At modobloom, every product is crafted with care and precision. Our team combines advanced technology with thoughtful design to create products that enhance daily comfort and well-being. Quality and sustainability guide everything we do.",
                "This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 3,500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $1B raised between them."

                "They work the same way: a spinning motor turns gears, gears move rods, and rods push the sanding head back and forth. We asked ourselves a simple question: Do we really need all of this just to move a sanding head?",
                "That’s when we went back to first principles. What do you actually need for perfect, controlled sanding? <span class=\"bold\">Direct, precise, linear motion. Nothing more.</span>",
                "This vertically mounted motor <span class=\"bold\">sends power straight to the sanding head</span> — no gears, no rods, just fast, snappy strokes.&nbsp;",
                "Detail sanding is a balancing act—too fast, and you ruin it; too slow, and you waste hours. And isn’t it ironic? Most “detail sanders” fail right where the work gets tricky.&nbsp;",
                "NeoSander hits the tight spot—<span class=\"bold\">a real detail sander that actually gets the details done.</span>",
                "Fast is great—but only if you can control it. Too much speed, like with rotary tools, can cause kickback, dig in, and mess things up. <span class=\"bold\">The right sanding motion is what lets you make the most of speed.</span>",
                "NeoSander’s straight-line motion covers more area efficiently, sanding fast while keeping your workpiece free from gouges—<span class=\"bold\">ideal for detailed work.</span>",
                "Nothing speaks louder than seeing it in action:",
                "But if the sanding head can’t reach the tight spot you want, all that high-speed motion means nothing.<br><br>That’s why NeoSander comes with <span class=\"bold\">8 head shapes</span> — each built for a different kind of tricky detail.",
                "The right head gets you there, but <span class=\"bold\">the right grit makes it shine</span>. NeoSander comes with 8 grits of sandpapers—taking you from rough shaping to mirror-smooth finishing.",
                "For better conformity on every surface, we created the Master Sandpaper Kit. Each grit includes <span class=\"bold\">3 standard sandpapers</span> and <span class=\"bold\">1 foam-layered sandpaper</span>, delivering a smoother finish and better contact on curves and uneven surfaces.",
                "Foam-Layered Sandpaper maintains consistent contact across uneven surfaces, absorbs excess pressure, and delivers controlled material removal—<span class=\"bold\">avoiding over-sanding on high spots while evenly sanding the entire surface.</span>",
                "When you’ve only got one set of sanding heads, limits everywhere — and changing grits can sometimes feel like a… <span class=\"bold\">Peel-and-Stick Marathon.</span>",
                "And one more thing: pick up your tool after some time… wait, what grit was this again? For detail-obsessed makers, losing track like that also disrupts your flow—exactly why <span class=\"bold\">a complete, organized system is a must.</span>",
                "With this color-coded combo, your grits always stay sorted and ready to swap. From coarse to fine, <span class=\"bold\">just grab the head you need, snap it on, and keep sanding.</span>",
                "The same back-and-forth motion that sands with ease <span class=\"bold\">also drives a saw blade effortlessly</span>, letting you flow seamlessly from sanding delicate details to cutting small pieces.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">wave-shaped double-tooth pattern</span> works perfectly with the reciprocating linear motion—one row cuts while the other clears debris—<span class=\"bold\">delivering faster, smoother cuts and reducing binding.</span>",
                "Have you noticed? NeoSander moves so fast, with strokes so tiny you can barely see — and yet <span class=\"bold\">every pass is spot-on precise.</span>",
                "At a fixed 13,000 SPM, NeoSander lets you fine-tune the stroke length (<span class=\"bold\">0.6–1.8 mm</span>) to control sanding speed, delivering a precise linear speed of <span class=\"bold\">260–780 mm/s</span>. ",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">*Linear speed formula: Speed (mm/s) = Stroke × 2 × SPM ÷ 60</span>",
                "These tight, controlled strokes deliver up to <span class=\"bold\">76%</span> more <span class=\"bold\">precision and reduce overreach</span> compared to other reciprocating sanders.",
                "The wobblier the strokes, the more the sanding head drifts—right into places you don’t want it to go.",
                "NeoSander is a different story: its reciprocating linear motor delivers the most direct, controlled strokes no other sander can match. No gears, no rods, <span class=\"bold\">no wandering sanding heads—precision guaranteed.</span>",
                "Most sanders aren’t built for pressure—they stall right away when pushed, low speed makes it worse.",
                "While most traditional sanders jam—gears lock, rods bind—when you push too hard, NeoSander just keeps going. Its adjustable-stroke linear motor ensures <span class=\"bold\">smooth, continuous motion no matter the challenge.</span>",
                "And the vibration doesn’t stop at your grip—it travels into the workpiece, buzzing your other hand. Before long, your hands go numb and precision slips away.",
                "To solve this, NeoSander uses a <span class=\"bold\">counterweight that moves opposite the sanding head</span>, canceling out most vibration and keeping your grip steady, even at full speed.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">No bulky housings blocking your view, no cords pulling you off balance</span>—just a compact tool that fits right in your palm and moves with your hand wherever the detail leads.",
                "Want to level up your sanding even further? <span class=\"bold\">Start with a cleaner cut</span>—because great sanding always begins before you even start sanding.",
                "NeoBlade, a <span class=\"bold\">Wireless Ultrasonic Cutter</span>, delivers <span class=\"bold\">precise, smooth cuts</span> with a blade vibrating at <span class=\"bold\">40,000 times per second</span>—leaving less work for NeoSander and smoother results overall.",
                "NeoSander masters the details. NeoBlock, on the other hand, handles the bigger surfaces.&nbsp;<br><br>When you crave the classic control of a sanding block, NeoBlock delivers—with <span class=\"bold\">quick-swap modular design</span> and <span class=\"bold\">secure belt tension</span>. Together, they cover every sanding need—from fine details to broad strokes.",
                "After the success of NeoBlade, we kept asking ourselves: could the same mechanism work for detail sanding? We tried, we tested… and quickly realized ultrasonic vibration wasn’t the answer.&nbsp;",
                "That challenge sparked a bigger question: how do we build a sanding tool that makers actually need — one that can tackle even the trickiest, tiniest details with ease?",
