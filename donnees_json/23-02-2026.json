And language is magical – it’s how humans explain and describe their world, it’s how we communicate with each other and the gods, it’s how we give shape to our experiences. The runes, like the letters, symbols, and words of many pre-Christian languages, hold within them the memory, inspiration, and wisdom of the Ancestors.",

                "In the tempestuous early days of 2025, I made three original paper theatre scenes to carry some of my strongest feelings about the power of ordinary people to rescue what we love and to resist authoritarianism. Two of those pieces—\"Keep A Light On\" and \"Ice Won't Win\"—are shown in the featured image in the banner for this campaign.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">In 2026, I want to make <span class=\"bold\">more pieces</span> in this same spirit and exhibit them together as a set. The number I'm able to make will be determined by the success of this campaign. I'll proceed even if I can only make one, but it is my hope that this Kickstarter will be able to fund the creation of at least three entirely new pieces.</span> <span class=\"text-italic\">See the \"Funding Structure and Stretch Goals\" section for more information about this.</span>",
                "In addition to the original pieces I'm hoping to create, I plan to scan each separate layer of these paper theatres and thread them together digitally to fashion a flat image version that can be sent digitally to backers at the \"Digital Print Supporter\" tier, and can be professionally-printed and mailed to backers at the \"Fine Art Print Supporter\" tier and above. This is a time-consuming process I couldn't afford to tackle with my previous paper theatres, but upfront funding can make it a possibility now.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Form</span><br>The tunnel books I created in 2025 were some of the most precious things I brought with me out of a very difficult year. In each place I have displayed them (both online and at in-person events) they have elicited strong and sometimes emotional reactions. For me, they have been <span class=\"bold\">what art can be at its very best: a vehicle that facilitates connection between human souls</span>. During a disheartening era where AI-generated material is poisoning people's ability to trust and enjoy art, these clearly-analog pieces responding to the current moment have been one of the primary things keeping me excited about creating. I want to do more work in this form because I believe it engages audiences effectively and encourages other to participate in creative work.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Content&nbsp;</span><br>In our time, values that once felt too elementary to make a hullabaloo about seem suddenly to be in dire need of a spirited defense. Similarly, coarse, mean-spirited attitudes that were once dismissed as cringe and fringe are being lauded in high places. I believe it is of urgent importance that Ordinary People push back against these trends and reaffirm in every way we know how that we have no intention of abandoning the core ethical principles that undergird a civil society: honest dealings, generosity of heart, support for humanitarian institutions, a spirit of welcome towards people fleeing violence, an ethic rooted in sharing rather than in hoarding, a determination to tackle problems collaboratively, and an avoidance of competitive bluster towards neighbors and allies.",
                "While I regularly donate to causes I believe in and participate in protests and visibility events, the arts always feel like my truest form of expression, and<span class=\"bold\"> I want to do more creative work that responds to our times with imagery that is also timeless</span>. &nbsp;",
                "\"No one is coming to save us\" people were saying in the dark days of early 2025 when the current U.S. administration took sudden aim at global alliances, refugee communities, crucial life-saving aid funding, public lands, free speech, democracy, the concept of empathy, and truth itself in a cascade of aggressive actions.&nbsp;<br><br>And I thought, without knowing whether it would prove true, <span class=\"bold\">\"We. We are coming to save us.\"</span>",
                "It's 2026 now. Our democracy is still under assault and we have been living through the nightmare of an active constitutional crisis for well over a year. But in the midst of all this, someone has been coming through and it's no one you've heard of. It's not a film star or a CEO or a senate minority leader. It's just this: ordinary people.",
                "All year long, ordinary people have been showing up to show care and support for their struggling communities and imperiled neighbors.",
                "Showing up to show a spirit of resistance towards the hardhearted cruelty and rampant lawlessness presently on display in the halls of power.",
                "Showing that rescue and resistance are often two sides of the very same coin.",
                "Ordinary people have been organizing food drives, fundraisers, and charity auctions to counter the worst affects of irresponsible funding cuts. Ordinary people have been giving up their time off to flock to protests by the millions. Ordinary people have stood outdoors in blowing snow and blazing heat to hold signs demanding moral courage from elected leaders. Ordinary people have been speaking up in public forums fully aware that using their voices may cost them friendships and business opportunities. Ordinary people have poured countless hours into vetting information in a disinformation hellscape, curating resources for their communities, and expressing resistance in poetry, painting, and song.",
                "We may feel small in the scheme of things, but there are so, so many of us. When each of us is doing the thing we know how to do, Ordinary People are a force that won't be easily stopped.",
                "These \"tunnel book\" paper theatre scenes are complex and extremely time-consuming to design and create. It typically takes me a full work week to make one, and handmade pieces that require this level of time and attention seldom sell for anything close to a living wage. Tackling this kind of project is thus a major financial commitment, and it keeps me away from work that can more reliably pay my bills. I've been dreaming about expanding this paper theatre series for over six months now, but have been kept away from it for financial reasons. Getting some upfront funding for this series via Kickstarter will allow me to take the necessary time away from gig work to make what is on my soul while the time is right.<br><br>Of course, depending on which support tier backers gravitate towards, the majority of the funds raised in this campaign will likely go directly towards printing, packaging, and shipping the little art prints that capture the new paper theatre scene(s) I create.",

                "Sarajevo, between the 50s and the end of the 20th century, had a central place in the artistic and cultural scene of the Balkans. A city that promoted the creation of art, where artist were close to their public, their work accessible and important to society, cultural centres were thriving, concerts, exhibitions and plays were the constantly happening, and visited in high numbers. Following the war of 1992, Sarajevo struggled to rebuild this cultural fervour, artists were no longer receiving the means to create and promote their work, places that were once dedicated to that effort, mostly public establishments, were either given new functions or left to abandonment.&nbsp;",
                "Today, Sarajevo is a city where culture and art clearly still hold the same importance it once did, but most artists eventually bump into the wall that is the lack of a space to show their work, to make it exist in society. It is now difficult for artists, particularly young emerging artists, to get the exposure and remuneration they need, not only making a career in art very difficult, which in turn makes their work difficult for the public to access and appreciate their work.&nbsp;",
                "The spirit and potential that fuelled the once thriving cultural and artistic scene of Sarajevo is still there, it however suffers from a lack of support and opportunities to express itself, the same can be said for the whole region.",
                "I am Sasha Mingasson, one of the young aforementioned emerging artists, during a brief period in the academy of fine arts of Sarajevo, I have met many young talented artists, full of ambitions, ideas and most importantly, with the will to contribute to the reconstruction of the local artistic scene. What they are lacking the most, is an outlet and the finances (or a prospect of remuneration), without which no artistic project can come to realisation, nor is a career in art feasible. It is because of this lack of prospect that lots of people with a passion and talent for art end up looking for a career elsewhere, which often, leads to a great and dangerous loss of authentic regional culture and art.&nbsp;",
                "It isn't for a lack of interest in art, because of an apathy and disinterest in culture that the situation is as it is, the few cultural events that do take place, such as the SFF (Sarajevo film festival), Jazz Fest, or exhibitions in the national gallery, are all visited in high numbers and are something that locals are proud of. These are things that are highly sought after, the only problem is the lack of funding, initiatives and spaces dedicated to art.&nbsp;",
                "In this in response to these difficulties, with the ambition to give these young emerging artists a voice and a presence in society, that i am opening Mezzanine. A space for this generation of artists to express themselves, to give them the public they need.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;Mezzanine is a multi-functional space, it will be a gallery that also functions as a print shop, with a small screen printing studio on the floor. Every month a different artist will use the exhibition space to exhibit his works, as of right now there are three artists in line, Ryan O'Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) and Tristan Berthoud (@Obscutrist). That space will also be used to display a catalogue of prints (mostly screen printed and giclee prints) from young artists of the region as well as to exhibit some of my works.&nbsp;",
                "The silk-screen printing studio will allow “Mezzanine” to have its own in-house production of screen printed prints, and give those artists the opportunity to print series of their works. It will also be used to print on hoodies and shirts, creating a collection of clothes with artworks by young local artists, not only turning their art into something wearable, but is also one of the best ways to get their works to be seen and talked about.",
                "The studio will also function as the economical backbone of the gallery, by offering screen printing services to businesses, a sort of an financial safety net.",
                "To make this project a reality, i need your help shouldering the initial costs. To give a second life to the space, and to acquire the material to set the studio up.&nbsp;",
                "The funds would go in the following :&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">all available works for postcards and prints will be communicated to backers at the end of the campaign. &nbsp;They will either be works of Sasha Mingasson or Tristan Berthoud, the choice is yours to make.&nbsp;</span>",
                "Sarajevo, entre les années 50 et la fin du XXe siècle, occupait une place centrale sur la scène artistique et culturelle des Balkans. C’était une ville qui encourageait la création artistique, où les artistes étaient proches de leur public, où leurs œuvres étaient accessibles et jouaient un rôle important dans la société. Les centres culturels étaient florissants ; concerts, expositions et pièces de théâtre se succédaient en permanence et attiraient un large public.&nbsp;",
                "À la suite de la guerre de 1992, Sarajevo a eu du mal à retrouver cet élan culturel. Les artistes ne disposaient plus des moyens nécessaires pour créer et promouvoir leur travail, et les lieux autrefois dédiés à cette mission — principalement des établissements publics — ont été réaffectés à d’autres usages ou laissés à l’abandon.&nbsp;",
                "Aujourd’hui, Sarajevo est une ville où la culture et l’art ont clairement conservé l’importance qu’ils avaient autrefois. Pourtant, la plupart des artistes finissent par se heurter à un obstacle majeur : le manque d’espaces pour exposer leur travail, pour leur permettre d’exister au sein de la société. Il est désormais difficile pour les artistes, en particulier les jeunes artistes émergents, d’obtenir la visibilité et la rémunération dont ils ont besoin. Cela rend non seulement une carrière artistique difficilement réalisable, mais limite également l’accès du public à leurs œuvres et sa capacité à les apprécier. L’esprit et le potentiel qui ont nourri la scène culturelle et artistique autrefois florissante de Sarajevo sont toujours présents.",
                "&nbsp;Cependant, ils souffrent d’un manque de soutien et d’opportunités pour s’exprimer. Cette ville, tout comme la région entière, a besoin de d'avantage de lieux pour exprimer et montrer son identité artistique, son âme. C’est un territoire riche de jeunes talents motivés qui restent invisibles. Dans ce contexte, chaque effort en faveur de la promotion de la culture et de l’art est essentiel. Je suis convaincue qu’avec un léger coup de pouce, ces jeunes artistes peuvent à nouveau occuper une place centrale dans la société d’aujourd’hui. Je souhaite y contribuer à mon échelle, en apportant ma propre pierre à l’édifice sous la forme d'une gallerie consacré à la promotion des jeunes artistes locaux émergents : <span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span>.",
                "Je m’appelle Sasha Mingasson, et je fais partie de ces jeunes artistes émergents mentionnés plus haut. Durant une brève période passée à l’Académie des Beaux-Arts de Sarajevo, j’ai rencontré de nombreux jeunes artistes talentueux, pleins d’ambition et d’idées, et surtout animés par la volonté de participer à la reconstruction de la scène artistique locale. Ce qui leur manque le plus, c’est un espace d’expression et des moyens financiers (ou une perspective de rémunération), sans lesquels aucun projet artistique ne peut voir le jour, et aucune carrière artistique n’est viable. C’est précisément faute de perspectives que de nombreuses personnes passionnées et talentueuses finissent par s’orienter vers d’autres carrières, ce qui conduit trop souvent à des œuvres et des artistes potentiels qui ne verront jamais le jour.",
                "&nbsp;La situation actuelle n’est pas due à un manque d’intérêt pour l’art, ni à une apathie ou un désintérêt pour la culture. Les rares événements culturels existants — tels que le SFF (Sarajevo Film Festival), le Jazz Fest ou les expositions à la Galerie nationale — attirent un public nombreux et constituent une véritable fierté locale. Ces événements sont très attendus ; le problème réside dans le manque de financements, d’initiatives et d’espaces dédiés à l’art.",
                "C'est en réponse à ces difficultés, avec l'ambition de donner à ces jeunes artistes émergents une voix et une présence dans la société, que j'ouvre Mezzanine. Un espace où cette jeune génération d'artistes pourra s'exprimer, et qui pourra leur donner une audience.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span> sera un espace multifonctionnel : une galerie qui fera également office de boutique de tirages (reproductions/prints), avec un petit atelier de sérigraphie intégré. Chaque mois, un artiste différent utilisera l’espace d’exposition pour présenter ses œuvres. À ce jour, trois artistes sont déjà prévus : Ryan O’Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) et Tristan Berthoud. Cet espace servira également à présenter un catalogue d’estampes (principalement des sérigraphies et des impressions giclée) réalisées par de jeunes artistes de la région, ainsi que certaines de mes propres œuvres.",
                "&nbsp;L’atelier de sérigraphie permettra à Mezzanine d’assurer une production interne de tirages en sérigraphie et d’offrir aux artistes la possibilité d’imprimer des séries de leurs œuvres. Il servira également à imprimer sur des sweats à capuche et des t-shirts, afin de créer une collection de vêtements ornés d’œuvres de jeunes artistes locaux. Cela permettra non seulement de rendre leur art portable, mais aussi d’en favoriser la diffusion et la visibilité. L’atelier constituera également l’ossature économique de la galerie, en proposant des services de sérigraphie aux entreprises — une sorte de filet de sécurité financier.",
                "Pour concrétiser ce projet, j’ai besoin de votre soutien afin de couvrir les coûts initiaux. Il s’agit de redonner vie à l’espace et d’acquérir le matériel nécessaire à l’installation de l’atelier.",

Our team brings over two decades of experience in developing practical modeling solutions for hobbyists, built on the shared knowledge of modelers across many genres and from all around the world.",
                "A little over a year ago, we introduced <span class=\"bold\">Ionic Smart Colors</span>, a new line created to support wargamers, tabletop gamers, and figure painters with that same experience and a shared passion. Thanks to your support, this new line, representing a new space for us, has continued to grow and evolve. We are truly grateful to the community for welcoming Ionic Smart Colors so warmly.",
                "Your feedback has always guided our work, and we’ve always listened. After many requests for more metallic colors, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to Ionic: the <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal</span> range...",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal </span>has been designed to provide hobbyists with all the metallics they could need for any project, from the classic silvers and golds, to metallics reds, blues, and more, with the same strengths and quality they are used to from Ionic. Featuring <span class=\"bold\">60 new</span> water-based acrylic paints in total, each color is manufactured with intense metallic pigments.&nbsp;",
                "<br>Each color is part of a set which provides an <span class=\"bold\">easy-to-use 3-Step Smart System</span> for painting true metallic metals consisting of a <span class=\"bold\">base, metallic wash, and highlight</span>. This system can be applied in order:<span class=\"bold\"> base &gt; metallic wash &gt; highlight</span> or varied based on personal preference, such as <span class=\"bold\">base &gt; highlight &gt; metallic wash</span>.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks to its simplicity, this system can be used by painters of <span class=\"bold\">any experience level</span>, whether you are a beginner painting your first army, or an experienced painter applying the metallic tones to your latest display piece. Real Heavy Metal is <span class=\"bold\">versatile </span>and can adapt to <span class=\"bold\">any technique</span> or method of application, be it brush, airbrush, drybrush, glazing, layering and more....&nbsp;",
                "The process of basecoat, wash, and highlight is a common methodology in any modeler's arsenal. However, because washes are typically matte, they can dull metallic finishes. Even glossy washes that preserve shine often reduce the metallic character of the pigments.",
                "Real Heavy Metal uses <span class=\"bold\">Metallic Washes</span> made from darkened versions of the same metallic pigments found in the base and highlight colors, helping <span class=\"bold\">preserve the metallic sheen</span> of your paintwork throughout the entire process. Painting True Metallic Metals has never been more metal!&nbsp;",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal Metallic Washes </span>are also highlighy pigmented. When used over metallics, this preserves the saturation and sheen of the metallic base color. However, when applied over a light color, such as white, they create shading and highlights with a single bushstroke. As you can see on the below example:",

We chose Kickstarter for this launch because it allows us to ensure hobbyists around the world receive their paints at the same time, while also giving us the opportunity to offer a special discount. We believe this is the fairest way to say thank you for the loyalty and support that has helped shape and grow Ionic. It also allows us to gauge demand so that <span class=\"bold\">no body is left waiting</span> for a second production run.",
                "Shipping costs will be collected <span class=\"bold\">after</span> the Kickstarter campaign ends. Once the campaign has concluded, we will contact all backers with a code for the pledge manager on our webstore. At that point, you will be able to select the specific sets and add-ons you would like. The webstore will calculate shipping options and costs based on the total weight and size of your pledge. We will then begin fulfilling your order.",
                "Pledges can be increased and add-ons added up until the time you pay for shipping. Our goal is to complete fulfillment by the end of <span class=\"bold\">September 2026</span>, although we will work hard to deliver your paints sooner. Production is ready to begin immediately, and the formulation has already been finalized.",
                "All items will ship from our warehouse <span class=\"bold\">in Spain</span>, from which we ship orders worldwide on a daily basis. Please note that backers may be responsible for customs duties, VAT, and other applicable import fees such as Tariffs. We please ask that you are aware of any such costs in your locality. Estimated shipping costs can be found on our webstore, by clicking <a href=\"https://www.migjimenez.com/en/content/1-entrega\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;",
                "Below you can watch videos made using the <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal </span>paints, we will update this list as more videos become available.",
                "Our team have already been putting the Real Heavy Metal range to work on their project, below you can see examples from their recent projects.&nbsp;"

                "The dream to become a small production potter is something I have possessed since high school. After acquiring my Fine Arts degree from Siena Heights University, I spent a decade without ceramics in my life at all. I never lost hope for my dream, and pressed on through jobs that weren’t my calling. A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to work as a studio assistant for Grayling Ceramics, owned by Shay and Maura Church. Grayling also got its start with the help of Kickstarter. Shay and Maura have provided me with the chance to hone my skills, and learn a great deal about how a small business operates. Harper Homestead Pottery will feature hand made wheel thrown ware that focuses on both function and details influenced by the natural world. While my business will be starting in my home, I do have a future goal to open a brick and mortar studio once I’ve grown the business. If my funds goal can be reached, I will finish out my basement studio, launch my website and business, and begin producing ware on a regular basis. I plan on continuing with my career at Grayling for now, until my business grows enough for me to go out on my own. I am excited to share my creative works with the world!&nbsp;"

                "Tarot cards have been used for eons to provide clarity around what feels overwhelmingly confusing, to confirm those little niggling feelings you have in your gut and can't quite place, or to provide a comforting cosmic squeeze to assure you that you are not alone.",
                "When you are standing at the threshold of your destiny, the cards can show you how to cross it.",
                "They are the Cosmic Translator - giving you the language to explain the feelings, fragmented thoughts, or physical sensations you experience when you are channeling divine guidance.",
                "And the symbols, artwork, colors, and composition of each card is what makes the language clear and concise.",
                "It is crucial to use a deck that you connect with visually, because that is what will make your messages come through, crystal clear.",
                "And that is why the Crystal Doorway Tarot was created.",
                "I wanted to reimagine the classic symbolism of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck in a way that will draw you in with its beauty and give you so many ways to clearly interpret what your intuition is trying to say.",
                "The digital collage art form allowed me to intuitively choose and layer exactly the right images to convey the traditional meanings of each card. And within those images, there are always going to be hidden details that reveal themselves only when necessary, allowing you to have a truly unique reading experience every single time.",
                "This deck consists of 78 full-color cards, with gold gilded edges.",
                "The card back design is unique for a tarot deck - the image is NOT the same whether the cards are upright or reversed! Honestly, I personally don't read reversals, so it didn't feel important to create the backs in a more traditional style.&nbsp;",

Players enter a rediscovered Atlantean ruin where: Reality subtly behaves incorrectly, Ancient guardians still follow forgotten commands, Sigils react to presence, and something deep below is beginning to awaken again",
                "This first chapter — <span class=\"bold\">Act I: The Inner Sanctum</span> — serves as the opening arc of a larger unfolding mythos. Future expansions will explore new ruins, deeper truths behind the Elixir, and the consequences of whatever choices players make here. Nothing in Atlantis ended cleanly. And nothing that awakens here will remain contained forever.",
                "This project was designed from the ground up for modern hybrid tabletop play. Instead of overwhelming Game Masters with dense rulebooks, we focused on tools that make encounters immersive and fast to run: High-detail STL miniatures for printing or digital use VTT-ready maps compatible with Foundry, Roll20, and Alchemy Encounter overlays, tokens, and environmental assets Modular DM Command Deck cheat systems Narrative hooks for different character archetypes Community-forged playtesting for balanced final stats Everything is structured to help Game Masters focus on storytelling rather than preparation fatigue.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">This is just a sample Cover of the LOREBOOK. Final Output will vary and be finalized on the FINAL CANON version. Though, what we have in mind is a rugged and old-looking book, if ever we can move forward to Phase 2, which is the Physical Copy.</span>",

They are part of the core campaign — not stretch goals.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What Each Character Reveal Includes:</span> Every revealed character isn’t just a model. You’ll receive: STL miniature (print-ready versions), VTT token assets, Stat block integration, Lore entry or narrative context, Gameplay compatibility with the encounter system, and Printable support materials where applicable.

This approach ensures: Continuous excitement during the campaign, Clear focus on each new unlock, Better community engagement, Time to properly showcase each addition, A stronger narrative build rather than random extras, You’re not just funding add-ons. You’re unlocking chapters of a growing universe.",

                "Long before the first empires carved their borders and before written history claimed authority over truth, there existed a civilization now known only through fractured legend — the Atlantean Ascendants. They did not conquer through armies or engines. They shaped existence through symbols, resonance, and an understanding of reality that modern minds would struggle to grasp. Their cities were instruments of power. White stone temples aligned to the heavens, corridors etched with sigils that hummed softly when walked upon, pillars that acted as anchors against forces unseen. Geometry was not decoration — it was technology. Language was not merely spoken — it was encoded into matter itself. Through these methods, they learned to stabilize energies that lay just beyond ordinary perception, energies ancient even then. For a time, their mastery seemed absolute. Their world prospered in a quiet brilliance that bordered on the sacred. Yet the deeper they looked into the fabric of existence, the more they began to sense that something vast was looking back. And still… they continued.",
                "Their greatest endeavor was not born of war or fear, but of ambition — a longing to transcend the fragile limits of mortality. From decades of research into alchemy, cosmic resonance, and sigil harmonics came the creation of the Crimson Elixir: a living medium said to bridge flesh and eternity. It shimmered with a beauty that unsettled even its creators, like liquid starlight laced with something darker. The Ascendants believed it could heal divine wounds, expand consciousness, and allow a chosen vessel to step beyond humanity without losing it. Mirelle was chosen. Brilliant. Attuned. Revered by many, quietly feared by others. Whether she volunteered out of hope, duty, or something more private remains debated in the fragments of surviving lore. What is known is that she entered the Inner Sanctum willingly — the most sacred convergence point of Atlantean architecture — where the final ascension ritual began. For a moment, everything aligned perfectly. Then reality began to resist.",
                "Witness accounts, though incomplete, describe a sudden stillness before the collapse — as if the world itself held its breath. No one knows why the sigils that had stabilized Atlantis for generations faltered. Energy surged without harmony. Structures meant to anchor dimensional forces began to fracture from within. The Inner Sanctum sealed itself instinctively, an automatic defense mechanism activated by forces far older than the <span class=\"bold\">Ascendants</span>. Entire districts vanished without a sound. Guardians awakened, not to protect the people, but to contain what had been unleashed. Mirelle did not die. But neither did she remain wholly human. The Crimson Elixir fused with her in a way no one had predicted, binding her to something vast, patient, and profoundly alien. She became a living anomaly — a nexus where reality bends, memory distorts, and time seems uncertain. Atlantis fell from history soon after. Survivors scattered. Records faded. Myths replaced memory. Yet the Sanctum never truly slept. It waited. And now, the seals are weakening after thousands of years - waiting for the right people to reactivate them.",
                "The Inner Sanctum is only the beginning. Future arcs will explore: Other Atlantean ruins, Hidden factions and guardians, The deeper truth behind the Crimson Elixir And what Mirelle’s awakening truly means for the world. Some answers may illuminate. Others may raise questions far more unsettling.",

                "I am raising funds for the purpose of skill sharing and cross cultural bridge building. I want to give away art materials to local Thai people and teach them how to use the materials for free. Ultimately, I want to promote a different kind of tourism by creating a Mecca for artists, which attracts artists from all over the world. I want to help the best practitioners from amongst my students to use their new skills to create fabulous art with a local theme and to teach others by putting on their own workshops. My name is Philip Potter. I am an artist. I am a teacher. I am a writer. And I have severe ET, a neurological disability similar to Parkinson’s disease. So, if I can do it, anyone can.&nbsp;<br><br>The starting point is the island of Phuket, Thailand. I have been offered a venue there to put on workshops and start an art club. I am hopeful that the project will become self-sustaining in approximately 12 months. To pay for the venue, I will teach art classes to the kindergarten pupils at my friend’s school as a way to pay her back for allowing me to use the school after the pupils have gone home. I intend to run art classes for the growing expatriate community - Thailand has been very proactive in making a welcoming environment for retired western people with easy access to long term visas etc. and an art class is a good way to meet new people and reduce isolation. I will also offer art workshops to visiting tourists who come from all over the world - people who want to experience something new. Once developed, these potential income streams will allow me to offer free art materials and art classes to local Thai people, building a bridge between all three communities. I intend to do this using Claude Monet landscapes aka Monet Magic. There is a strong historical connection between French Impressionism and Thailand, which became popular there in the mid twentieth century.&nbsp;",
                "The Monet Magic idea was developed while teaching in Indonesia - I needed a method that produced quick wins as well as a lasting sense of achievement. This technique works in all areas, from private one-to-one lessons to corporate well-being workshops. It turns ‘can’t do’ staff into ‘can do’ staff and it tackles the reluctant artist’s fear of facing a blank piece of paper. Any problem can be solved with the right approach, the right tools and the right techniques. I can teach anyone to replicate a Monet landscape in 2-3 hours using a step-by-step mixed media approach. The resulting paintings leave the participants both amazed and excited over what they have achieved.&nbsp;<br><br>Being able to visually interpret the world around you and the world inside you is a ticket to better mental health and well-being as well as a saleable skill. Using your brain in a variety of ways can help in every area of life, leading to higher level thinking and more robust levels of concentration. This technique releases gamma waves in the brain in the same way solving a complex maths problem leads to a eureka moment - but without the maths. Monet is just the vehicle for the technique - once you have mastered the process you will be ready to create your own masterpieces quickly and confidently.&nbsp;",
                "In a class, everyone paints the same picture. You will be taken through a step-by-step process. Everything is explained and demonstrated, so whether you learn better visually or through instruction your needs are catered for and as I show you what to do there is no language barrier. The painting is broken down into its constituent elements and rebuilt from the ground up. The class ends when the participant’s painting looks as near as possible a twin to the original. The process takes approximately 3 hours. It works like magic.",

                "My story with clay began in a high school ceramics classroom exactly 28 years ago. I fell in love with the tactile, transformative nature of the medium, but as life often does, it called me in a different direction. I set that dream aside to focus on being a mother and a wife, dedicating years to building a family and a home. The clay was gone from my hands, but the artist inside was simply waiting.",
                "Ten years ago, life shifted. Following a divorce and a beautiful new marriage, my husband and I were shopping for the everyday items to furnish our new home together. I found myself deeply dissatisfied with the commercial mugs, bowls, and plates we were finding. They felt soulless and lacked character.",
                "When I told my husband that these pieces were boring and that I believed I could do better, he didn't just nod—he gave me the push I needed. He asked why I wasn't creating, and he encouraged me to pick up the practice again.",
                "I returned to the studio a decade ago and haven’t looked back. Today, DYRPottery is the realization of a dream that has been in my heart for nearly three decades.",
                "My work is a celebration of the human touch. I choose not to use a pottery wheel; instead, I focus on the rhythmic, intentional methods of slabs, coils, and pinch posts. This process allows me to build a piece from the ground up, feeling the character of the clay in every seam and texture. By hand-building, I ensure that every mug, bowl, and plate has its own unique silhouette. When you hold a piece of DYRPottery, you are holding a piece of a story—one that is \"perfectly imperfect\" and entirely handmade.",
                "I have been creating and selling pieces to friends and family, but to truly bring my work to the public and scale my studio, I need to \"bring the fire\" home.",

Now, Marnie’s a ghost trapped on Earth, and the only one who can help her is the overenthusiastic, alien social worker, Xel, whose job is to help ghosts “close their file” and pass on. Are you ready for a sweetly nostalgic trip through Marnie’s life, correcting mistakes and righting what once went wrong? Well sorry, this isn’t that story! Xel has a much better idea to soothe Marnie’s troubled spirit: an internship in the hopeless bureaucracy of the trans-dimensional Department of Spectral Affairs!\n\nThis new do-gooder duo has their work cut out for them in a series of hilarious mishaps and misadventures throughout the space-time continuum (but mostly in and around the office) as Marnie finds pathways through her feelings of worthlessness by helping others."

Joseph’s pluck and kid logic not only charm the president, but they soon help resolve a thorny trade dispute. This gives POTUS an idea. Across the ocean, eight-year-old boy king Nang Nukatau III has taken his father's crown and clumsily stumbled into an international incident, and now Joseph’s got a pressing mission: talk the tiny dictator back from the brink of war!\n\nThe diplomatic slumber party soon goes from awkward to scary as the castle is stormed and the boys are lost across South Korea and Japan where they have to outrun bad guys, learn to read Hangul, unravel the riddle of Gyeongbok Palace, break out of an abandoned bathhouse, befriend an army of snow monkeys, and crack the Case of the Missing Dragon!"

In another time, the two women would have kept one another’s company forever in their little attic bedroom, living out their days in the employ of a Lord. But it’s now the dawn of a new age. The expanding empire has brought with it not only plundered wealth, but worldliness and new ideas. Suffragists agitate in the street, idle-rich bohemians challenge sexual mores, and Patience and Esther slowly come to realize the world is wider and full of more adventure and opportunity than they ever imagined."

Instead, she finds herself hiding in a basement as the youngest member of an underground banned book club. And as Hyun Sook soon discovers, in a totalitarian regime, the delights of discovering great works of illicit literature are quickly overshadowed by fear and violence.\n\nIn BANNED BOOK CLUB, Hyun Sook shares her dramatic true story of political strife, fear-mongering, the death of democratic institutions, and the relentless rebellion of reading."

The only problem is, for everything he knows about magic, he knows nothing about adventuring, and he’ll have to figure this one out as he goes, far from the comforting safety of home. \n\nIn over his head, along with his equally inexperienced new allies, Dr. Baer sets out on a dangerous quest through a world of monsters and magic to set things right . . . and to find his next chapter."

None have yet to reach the bottom and return to tell the tale. Each party gathers daily for a new round of potion-making, sword-sharpening, armor-buying, and dungeon-crawling, and after hours of leveling up in dangerous battles with monstrous creatures from the depths, they rest and try again the next day when everything repeats. That is, until one adventurer stops to ask why. Is it endlessly exciting, or simply endless?\n\nIn a witty, genre-defying tale of magic, mystery, and philosophy, brave warriors must learn the difference between diversion and escape as they try to break the cycle of a penultimate quest in which the final fantasy never arrives."

Their? Its?) flock.\n\nThe only black camper in the group—and queer besides—she struggles to reconcile the innocent intent of the trip with the blinkered obliviousness of those determined to keep the Three Peaks tradition going. As the journey wears on and the rhetoric wears thin, Charlie can't help but poke holes in the pious disregard this storied sanctuary has for outsiders like herself—and her fellow camper, Sydney.\n\nAs the Crow Flies is a Stonewall Honor Book, and is the first volume in a series!"

In another time, the two women would have kept one another’s company forever in their little attic bedroom, living out their days in the employ of a Lord. But it’s now the dawn of a new age. The expanding empire has brought with it not only plundered wealth, but worldliness and new ideas. Suffragists agitate in the street, idle-rich bohemians challenge sexual mores, and Patience and Esther slowly come to realize the world is wider and full of more adventure and opportunity than they ever imagined."

The only problem is, for everything he knows about magic, he knows nothing about adventuring, and he’ll have to figure this one out as he goes, far from the comforting safety of home. \n\nIn over his head, along with his equally inexperienced new allies, Dr. Baer sets out on a dangerous quest through a world of monsters and magic to set things right . . . and to find his next chapter."

What starts as a simple plan becomes a wild summer full of witches, gnomes, feelings, magical chickens, and more as they prepare for the big race.\n\nWill Ken and Dante finish first? Can they even make it to the finish line? And more importantly, what happens when this racing duo blooms into something more?\n\nBursting to the brim with crazy monsters, blazing automotive action, deep-rooted mysteries, and small-town secrets, HEX AMERICANA is the race everyone’s dying to win!"

In this climate of tension and transformation, where institutions were questioned and hierarchies challenged, <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant </span></span>and <span class=\"bold\">Humanoids</span> were born. Rather than retreating into the shadows, their founding fathers chose to seize their chosen medium to push against boundaries and conventions, giving voice to their fears, their dissent, and their wildest dreams and fantasies.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant,</span></span><span class=\"bold\"> since its origins, has been very open about sex and the representation of sexuality, including its oft-deviant nature, but always with a unique elegance that honored and explored, as opposed to mere exploitation.</span> There are countless treasures published throughout Humanoids’ early years, one of the most profound being the sophisticated yet vulgar allegory of <span class=\"text-italic\">Polonius</span>, penned by Picaret and illustrated by the renowned Jacques Tardi. Originally published in 1976, the rare, complete, 44-page tale is republished in English (for the first time since 1977) in <span class=\"text-italic\">Metal Hurlant Issue 4: Paradise Lost, </span>available through this campaign. <span class=\"text-italic\">Read more about the careful technique used at the time to create gray tones, both in this work by Tardi and in Varenne’s, A Feast for the Eyes.</span>",

                "<span class=\"text-italic\">When Tardi drew the pages of </span><span class=\"bold\">Polonius</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> fifty years ago, computers were not part of the process. If an artist wanted black-and-white pages with nuanced gray atmospheres, options were limited. You could paint the page in gray wash, but printing results were uncertain. Or, to keep dense black lines, you could draw the page, then paint the gray areas on a reduced reproduction of the original, printed in blue on paint-friendly paper, which would be scanned and combined with the film from the original black line. It worked, but it was complicated and costly.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">The alternative, if you were meticulous, patient, and talented, was self-adhesive screentone: in Europe, Letraset; in the United States, Zip-A-Tone. Charles M. Schulz used it for the gray spots in his Peanuts strips, though in a light and simple way.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Screentone was a transparent adhesive sheet printed with a halftone pattern. You cut it to shape and applied it directly to the original art, where it stayed in place, or you laid it over the area to be shaded and trimmed away the excess with an artist’s knife. These pages are surprisingly hard to reproduce today, and modern printing does not automatically make it easier.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Several key works in this campaign, Varenne’s </span><span class=\"bold\">Tears of Sex</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> and Tardi and Picaret’s </span>Polonius<span class=\"text-italic\"> (as published in </span><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant Issue 4</span><span class=\"text-italic\">), were made with this method, which gives them the distinctive gray tones we love, a look largely lost since the arrival of digital tools.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Only a few cartoonists truly mastered it. Varenne pushed the technique to its limit. He drew on acetate with a pen and brush, using ink that bites into the plastic, then applied screentone to the reverse of the transparent sheet to build those atmospheric grays. The first time I met him, in early 1989 to discuss </span><span class=\"bold\">Tears of Sex</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> (the year I took over Humanoids), Alex told me that inking on plastic made the line extra fluid and helped the spontaneity he was after while inking. You can catch a glimpse of his breathtaking originals in the opening scene of this campaign’s video (yes, they are originals...).</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">To my knowledge, among all the artists Humanoids has worked with over the past fifty years, Varenne is the only one who used this unique technique and did wonders with it. Even beyond Humanoids, I do not see another comparable example.</span>",

                "All funds raised through sponsorships, donations, and patrons will be used entirely to support the development and ongoing improvement of this interactive cyberpunk suspense and horror graphic novel / experience.<br>Specifically, the money will go toward:<br>Paying our programmers, who are building the interactivity, branched narrative paths, sanity system, dynamic glitches, choice mechanics, and exclusive post-credits content.<br>Compensating our writers, who are responsible for crafting the deep storylines, disturbing dialogue, revelations about Dc. Micron Skyrunner, the mysteries of the Funhouse, and the dark cyberpunk tone that makes this work unique.<br>There are no middlemen or unnecessary expenses: every dollar contributed goes directly to the people creating and expanding this universe for you.<br>Thanks to your support, we can continue to pay for their talent, time, and dedication to deliver more chapters, alternate endings, hidden files, and updates that make Micron’s amusement park increasingly twisted and immersive.<br>Your contribution doesn’t just fund a project — it keeps the glitch alive and allows the creators to keep dreaming (and terrifying) alongside us!",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Singularity</span></span><br>A scientific horror interactive graphic novel<br>A sealed mansion.<br>A forgotten laboratory.<br>Hundreds of inactive androids… staring at nothing.<br>And one name erased from every record:<br>Dr. Micron Skyrunner.<br>Singularity is an interactive graphic novel that blends scientific horror, psychological mystery, and puzzle-driven exploration. Every object is a clue. Every room is a question. Every discovery changes what you think is real.<br>You awaken with fragmented memories inside the abandoned Skyrunner Complex — a research facility shut down after an experiment that should never have existed.<br>No bodies.<br>No staff.<br>Only humanoid machines standing in silent rows… and systems that still power on as if they were waiting for you.<br>Something here recognizes you.<br>🧠 Gameplay<br>Inspired by classic point-and-click adventures and narrative horror experiences:<br>Side-scroll exploration through detailed pixel-art environments<br>Interactive inventory (inspect, rotate, combine objects)<br>Logic-based puzzles grounded in physics and real science<br>Sanity system: what you see may not be trustworthy<br>Branching narrative choices and multiple endings<br>Environmental storytelling through notes, photos, recordings, and fragmented memories<br>Nothing is decorative.<br>A rusted ring. A family photograph.

                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Why did I choose this linear format instead of episodes?</span></span><br>I want the story to feel like an immersive movie or graphic novel: intense, emotional, and with an uninterrupted rhythm. Every decision matters because it's part of an organic whole, and the impact of your choices builds gradually toward the climax and ending (with multiple possible conclusions depending on your paths).",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">And a demo?</span></span><br>If the campaign is successful and we reach (or exceed) the funding goal, my plan is to release a free playable demo 2 month before the official launch of the full game. This demo will include the introduction + the first major story arc (about 20-25% of the full experience), so more people can try it, experience the atmosphere, and share it.<br>This way, all backers get exclusive early access to the complete version first, while the demo helps build wider interest and community in the lead-up to release.",
                "How We Plan to Create It (Main Steps from Now to Final Delivery)<br>Currently, the full direction of the story is already complete: we have the entire script, narrative structure with all arcs, branches, revelations, well-developed characters, and detailed emotional handling. This allows us to move forward in a very focused and efficient way.<br>The main steps are as follows:<br>Final Writing and Refinement (ongoing / nearly complete): Polish dialogues, ensure consistency across branches and the sanity system, and prepare all text for integration.<br>Art and Visual Assets (in progress): Create or finalize pixel art environments, character sprites, backgrounds, and interactive elements, using tools like Adobe Firefly for quick prototypes followed by manual refinement. (IA)<br>Programming and Interactivity (next major step): Our programming team will implement the core mechanics: choice-based system (clicking buttons to select options/dialogues), branched paths, simple inventory, sanity system (with dynamic visual glitches and effects), and logic-based puzzles rooted in real science. The game is primarily choice-based (button selections for narrative decisions), combined with light point-and-click elements (clicking objects to inspect, rotate, or combine them), making it accessible and heavily focused on horror storytelling.",
                "<br>Integration and Internal Testing (after programming): Combine all elements (art + narrative + code), test branches, choice outcomes, sanity balance, bugs, and performance across different Windows PCs.<br>Beta Testing with Backers (optional, if time/margin allows): Share an early version with a small group of backers for feedback and final polishing.",
                "&nbsp;Compile the complete version as a Windows executable (.exe), package it, and deliver to all backers.<br>The entire process is designed to be linear and efficient, thanks to the existing narrative foundation.<br>How We Will Distribute It<br>Main Format: Digital download DRM-free as a Windows executable (.exe). This is a standard, secure, and straightforward option for indie narrative games like this: backers simply download the file, run it, and play offline without any additional client or constant internet connection required.<br>Primary Distribution Platform: We will use itch.io (the most popular and reliable platform for DRM-free indie games). We’ll set up a private or restricted project page exclusively for backers, where they can download the .exe directly (or via the itch.io app, which handles automatic updates). itch.io is perfect because:<br>It supports importing your Kickstarter backer list directly (via CSV export from Kickstarter), granting automatic access to matching emails.<br>Allows private/restricted pages, exclusive download keys, or backer-only URLs for secure delivery.<br>Handles updates seamlessly: upload a new version (patches, bug fixes, extra content), and backers get notified and can download automatically.<br>It's free to publish, widely used by the indie community (especially for horror/narrative titles), and ensures true DRM-free ownership.<br>Alternatives if Needed: For extra security, we can provide private links via Google Drive or Dropbox for specific backers, but itch.io will be the main hub for simplicity and reliability. In the future, if the project expands significantly, we may consider adding Steam support, but the priority is DRM-free and easy access right from launch.<br>Updates and New Content: Any patches, bug fixes, additional chapters (if expanded post-launch), or extra content will be uploaded directly to the same itch.io page. Backers will receive automatic notifications (via email or the itch.io app) and can download updates at no extra cost. We’ll also use Kickstarter updates to announce and explain changes.<br>This ensures all backers receive the full game first, in a clear, hassle-free way. If the project grows, we’ll evaluate ports for Mac/Linux, but the initial focus is Windows for fastest delivery.<br>&nbsp;"

                "<span class=\"bold\">The day my mom Deborah died in 2024, someone gave me a popular book on Jewish grief. Like most resources on Jewish grief, it was normatively masculine and heteronormative. The tome included a large section on whether women’s voices were too holy to participate (yikes).&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">But I desperately needed a similar resource that would instruct me about Jewish grief and what was expected of me. My friends and loved ones needed one too.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Thus </span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Jewish Weirdo’s Guide to Grief </span></span><span class=\"bold\">was born.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">In writing my book, I took inspiration from a long line of Jewish graphic novelists and cartoonists – Stan Lee and Art Spiegelman for two notable examples. Graphic novels have a long Jewish history of helping us parse hard topics through funny or subversive pictures.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Who is this book for?&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">You might ask, who is a Jewish weirdo? I claim this term for everyone like me who draws from the margins toward the middle, who enjoys or is curious about inclusive Judaism.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">My friends and loved ones, who wanted to be supportive during the aninut (period of time between death and burial), shiva, and beyond, needed a resource like this. They wanted to support me but didn't know what was expected of them or what to say.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">&nbsp;Jewish or not, if you want to help someone grieve Jewishly, you’re enough of a Jewish weirdo for me.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We all feel lost and alone in times of great grief. In times such as these, Judaism has ancient scripts for us to follow. I want to show my readers how those ancient scripts, updated for my modern lens, helped me and can help them.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">For one example, shiva practice instructs us to stay close to each other for the first seven days of grief. “Show up and give them silence,” an ancient Jewish precept about shiva, is one of my personal favorites.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">In the midst of grief, there may simply be nothing you can say. You can sit next to the griever and look into the crater where their life used to be.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">But over and over, Jewish practice has helped me feel surrounded by care in the midst of devastating grief. I hope that my book will be a light-hearted introduction to the ways Judaism helps us move toward each other in grief.</span>",

Black Heart, an imprint of Every Day is Valentine's Day Publishing, was born out of necessity and a refusal to be silenced.\r\n\r\nI started writing because I had to. All other doors were closed, so I had to kick one open. I began with children’s books, but I moved into comics because the world needed a 'Wolf' that the gatekeepers were too soft to provide. While the sheep were following weak leaders and pulling wool over everyone's eyes with soft stories and fragile heroes, I was sharpening my teeth.\r\n\r\nWe are Wolves. We are hungry. I’m in the kitchen, let me cook. It’s time to eat. It’s time for Absolute Change.",

                "Mohammad&nbsp;Sayed&nbsp;(Moh), a disability rights advocate, inventor, and motivational speaker, disabled himself as a youngster in Afghanistan, started his mission to “redefine normal” by promoting and advocating accessibility and inclusion for wheelchair users and the disabled at large. Now through Lets Roll Productions, Moh continues this mission with powerful stories told with dynamic graphic novels and short films that inspire and empower disabled people to be heroes in their own right - everyday. If you have followed our stories up to now, you already know that LRP’s first disabled superhero, Wheelchair Man came to life in 2016 and told the story of a fragmented childhood and the rocky path to becoming a superhero. Moh is faced with the ultimate consequences of war at a very young age. His childhood is abruptly halted by the all too common violence against civilians. By confronting his physical obstacles and tremendous loss, Moh is able to gain an extraordinary ability. This power allows Moh to aid and prevent harm to those who experience similar losses due to the brutality of war. Wheelchair Man’s story resonated with over 4,000 readers across Afghanistan, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, and the United States. The story was translated into Dari and Pashto, printed, and distributed throughout these countries. Notably, the state department sponsored these trips.&nbsp;",

And that never sat right with us. We believe <span class=\"bold\">repair shouldn’t feel harder than replacement</span>. It should feel intuitive and empowering.<br><br>That belief shaped everything that came next -<br><br><span class=\"bold\">WE WANTED TO MAKE REPAIR TOOL, REPAIRABLE.</span><br><span class=\"bold\">A TOOL FOR VERSATALITY, VERSATILE.</span>",
                "Meet the Combine Driver — a modular, repairable 2-in-1 ratchet and torque screwdriver designed for everyday repair and making.",
                "Engineered for precision, built for longevity, and designed as a complete desktop system, it brings torque control, modular bits, and sustainable construction into one thoughtfully designed tool.",

A modular kit that starts simple and expands intentionally, without cluttering your workspace or forcing unnecessary replacements.<br><br>Whether you’re beginning with a few essentials or building a serious toolkit over time, the stack adapts with you. Add only what you need. Carry only what you use. Keep everything visible, accessible, and easy to repair.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎DESIGNED TO BE A DESKTOP SCULPTURE:</span><br>The Combine Driver was designed to stay visible, not tucked away.<br>Balanced proportions, honest materials and an architecture that brings a quiet yet bold presence on your desk.<br><br>It’s a tool you reach for often, and one that feels considered even when it’s at rest.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎DESIGNED AS A SYSTEM AND NOT JUST AN OBJECT:</span><br>What appears as a single tool is a carefully considered system. A rotary base, modular stack, and the Combine Driver itself; each designed to work independently, yet composed to function better together.<br><br>Nothing is decorative. Nothing is fixed. <br>Every element exists to support access, adaptability, and repair; whether the tool is in use, being reconfigured, or simply at rest on your desk.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎ENTIRE ASSEMBLY HELD TOGETHER BY JUST 6 M3 SCREWS:</span><br>The Combine Driver has no adhesives, lock-tights, permanent welds and environmentally toxic surface treatments, making it fully&nbsp;repairable by you.",
                "Sustainability, for us, meant looking beyond the object and designing the system around it. From disassembly to material use and manufacturing methods, each decision was made with the full <span class=\"bold\">lifecycle</span> in mind.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">▎HERE'S HOW DESIGN AND SYSTEMS THINKING GUIDED OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY:</span>",

                "We intentionally engineered the connector housing with additional clearance to accommodate phones with protective cases. The width aligns with your device, while the depth and structural offset are carefully balanced to ensure the connector remains fully accessible — even when a case is installed.",
                "That means no removing your phone case.<br>No forcing tight connections.<br>No awkward pressure against the frame.",
                "The interface area is purposefully spaced to avoid collision with case edges, allowing a clean and secure fit across most standard case designs.",
                "Because everyday phones are protected — and your accessories should respect that.",
                "PortRing is available in two main connector versions: <span class=\"bold\">USB-C</span> and <span class=\"bold\">Lightning</span>.",

                "We are a small team of designers and engineers who focus on one thing:<br><span class=\"bold\">making everyday phone accessories smarter, simpler, and more functional.</span>",
                "We believe great products don’t add complexity — they remove it.<br>That’s why we design accessories that integrate directly with your device, using thoughtful structure and engineering instead of bulky add-ons.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">PortRing</span> was born from a simple frustration:<br>phone stands block charging, and charging accessories don’t support viewing.<br>So we rethought the charging port itself — turning it into a structural anchor that supports charging, data transfer, and hands-free use at the same time.",
                "From early sketches to functional prototypes, every detail of PortRing was designed by our team — from the port layout and magnetic balance to real-world case compatibility.",
                "Kickstarter allows us to bring this idea directly to people who value practical, well-designed tools.<br>With your support, we can turn PortRing from a refined prototype into a product used every day."

                "<span class=\"bold\">Never-clean Kat Kolosseum (Patent Pending)</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Introduction</span>",
                "After 30+ years of using different types of cat litter boxes, I grew tired of having to clean boxes, scoops, machines, and machine parts.&nbsp; I decided that I would attempt to design a new cat litter box, that as a minimum, I would only have to clean on an infrequent basis.&nbsp; However, as my design began to take shape, I realized that if I incorporate multiple specific objectives, and that these objectives can be met, the end result will be a cat litter unit that NEVER needs to be cleaned (not including removal of excrement).",
                "The single over-riding objective that must be met in order to be able to claim a ‘never-clean’ status, is that the feline must not be able to reach <span class=\"bold\">any of the supporting structure</span> of the new litter box (i.e. feline only has access to litter).",
                "A subset of objectives (claims) that will support the main objective are as follows:",
                "1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cats love the corners of their litter box.&nbsp; So, we remove the corners!&nbsp; In other words, the new design must be round.",
                "2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cats love to dig down to the bottom of the litter box.&nbsp; To minimize the possibility of reaching the bottom, we design the litter box to be deep.",
                "3.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we keep the cats away from the sides of the litter box?&nbsp; We restrict their movement!&nbsp; The lid of the new design is round with a hole in the center, like a donut!",
                "4.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we simplify the removal of urine clumps and feces?&nbsp; We incorporate a sifting mechanism in the new design.&nbsp; This allows all clean litter to be fully recovered, each time the owner removes cat excrement.",
                "5.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we replace the sifting section without having to transfer all the remaining clean litter, and creating significant dust in the process?&nbsp; A bowl-shaped sifting basket has been included in the new design that ‘slips under’ the remaining clean litter, which does not produce any dust.",
                "Drawings and photos of the final prototype of the new design are as follows:",

                "<br><br>Drei Magazine, drei unterschiedliche Perspektiven, ein großes Thema.<br><br>Was ist das eigentlich Unvernunft?<br>Wie viele Facetten der Unvernunft gibt es zu entdecken?<br><br>Wir wollen dazugehören und uns dennoch entfalten. Wir wollen träumen, aber auch realistisch bleiben. Dabei stehen wir oft unter Druck und spüren Gegensätze in uns aufsteigen.<br><br>Das Magazin „No Pressure\" erzählt aus eigenen Erfahrungen und Beobachtungen, in wie vielen unterschiedlichen Lebensreichen sich Unvernunft im Gewand des Alltages versteckt.<br><br>Das Magazin „Rauchapause\" will am liebsten einfach mal auf die Pausetaste drücken und sich in Träumereien und unvernünftigen Gewohnheiten flüchten.<br><br>Das Magazin „Mischkonsum\" will keine Regeln und Grenzen setzen, sondern schlummerndes Unvernunft-Potenzial in uns wecken.",
                "<br><br>Alle Hefte vereint eines, dass wir uns selbst hinterfragen und Einblicke in unser Leben geben. Mit vielfältigen Illustrationen werden die Artikel nicht nur mit Worten, sondern besonders stark mit unseren Bildwelten erzählt.<br><br>Wir wollen euch einladen mit uns in jene Bildwelten abzutauchen und freuen uns sehr über Eure finanzielle Unterstützung.<br><br>Wir brauchen 1.500 Euro für die Produktion unserer kleinen Magazinstrecken-Auflage.<br><br>Das Ganze wird voraussichtlich im März gedruckt, wenn wir genügend Unterstützer:innen finden.<br><br>Wir freuen uns über jeden, der uns jungen Kreativschaffenden die Möglichkeit gibt, so ein großes Projekt mit Leidenschaft umzusetzen und hoffentlich bald den Duft von frischbedrucktem Papier in den Händen zu halten.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">English Version:</span>",
                "Dear colourful souls, lovers of creativity, wonderers, curious minds, and inquisitive thinkers…<br>We, 15 emerging illustrators from AID Berlin want to bring our major magazine project to life together with you!",
                "For months now, we’ve been working behind the scenes on <span class=\"text-italic\">“Oben Ohne”</span>, a magazine series that invites readers to peel back the pages of Unvernunft. Three magazines, three different perspectives, one shared theme. What is Unvernunft, really?<br>How many facets of Unvernunft are there to discover? We want to belong, yet still unfold. We want to dream, but also stay realistic. Along the way, we often feel pressure and sense contradictions rising within us.",
                "The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“No Pressure”</span> draws from personal experiences and observations to explore the many areas of life where Unvernunft hides in the clothing of everyday routines. The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“Rauchapause”</span> longs to hit the pause button, drifting into daydreams and delightfully unvernünftige habits. The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“Mischkonsum”</span> refuses to set rules or boundaries, instead awakening the dormant potential for Unvernunft within us. All three issues share one thing: we question ourselves and offer glimpses into our lives. Through a wide range of illustrations, the articles are told not only through words, but powerfully through our visual worlds.",
                "We invite you to dive into these visual worlds with us and we are deeply grateful for your financial support. We need €1,500 to produce our small magazine print run. Printing is planned for March, provided we find enough supporters. We appreciate everyone who gives us young creatives the opportunity to bring such a passionate project to life and hopefully soon hold the scent of freshly printed pages in our hands.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">English subtitels for the video:</span>",
                "Hey guys,",
                "I'm Kaya from the 5th semester of the Akademie for Illustration und Design Berlin.",
                "We currently work on a collaborative magazine project about our topic \"Unvernunft\" (translates to irrationality, unreasonability)",
                "In three different editions we address serious topics such as society criticism as well as foolish nonsense from our everyday life. To fulfill our goal, we opened an Instagram account where you can watch behind the scenes moment or follow our progress. We also opened a Kickstarter campaign, opening the possibility for those who want to financially support us. If we were able to make you interested, we'd be very glad if you'd take a look! Thank you very much!",

                "The early 1920s marked a period of explosive growth for New York City. Skyscrapers began to pierce the skyline, and neighborhoods filled with families eager to enjoy the comforts of modern living. Among the prized possessions filling these homes were woolen goods—rugs, tapestries, fur coats, sweaters, and suits. Wool, known for its warmth and durability, became a symbol of prosperity and refinement.",
                "But as the city grew denser and more goods were stored away, a silent invader found its opportunity: the carpet moth. These tiny insects, harmless as adults, laid eggs that hatched into larvae—voracious eaters of animal-based fibers. Over time, the damage escalated from a nuisance to a citywide crisis. Homeowners watched in dismay as their prized textiles were devoured from within, the larvae spinning cocoons and emerging as moths to restart the cycle.",
                "The scale of the problem demanded a scientific response. Laboratories across the country, and especially in New York, began searching for a chemical deterrent. By the mid-1920s, researchers discovered that certain fluoride compounds could be highly effective against moth larvae. Among the pioneers was the Larvex Corporation, which patented a water-soluble, non-toxic, and odorless solution: ammonium silicofluoride. This innovation was safe for home use, gentle on wool, and easy to apply—though it required reapplication after cleaning, as it was not permanent.",
                "Still, the quest for a permanent fix continued. Sodium fluoride, paired with an acid solution, offered longer-lasting protection but proved harsh on both wool and skin. Over time, the risks outweighed the benefits, and the industry returned to safer, though temporary, solutions.",
                "The story of mothproofing did not end with Larvex. The company was eventually absorbed by a larger conglomerate, and by the 1930s–40s, both the patents and the formulas faded into obscurity. Yet, the knowledge was not entirely lost. On the East Coast and in select Bay Area rug plants, cleaning specialists continued to use these formulas, passing them down through generations or company sales.",
                "Cary Cleaning Specialists, a Bay Area institution from the 1930s to 1960s, became stewards of the ammonium silicofluoride method. When Simonian Rugs acquired Cary Cleaning Specialists in 1956, they inherited not just a business, but a legacy of textile protection. For decades, Simonian Rugs quietly safeguarded the region’s rugs and tapestries, using a formula that had all but disappeared elsewhere.",
                "In the 1970s, Joseph Bezjidian, owner of Simonian Rug Cleaners, formally acquired Cary’s mothproofing solution and continued to use it in his facility. The Simonian family, drawing on generations of expertise in textile care, maintained the tradition, even as the rest of the industry moved on to other methods—freezing, heat treatments, mothballs, and scented deterrents. These alternatives, while helpful, often failed to match the effectiveness and safety of the original formula.",
                "In 2008, Austin Reinders took ownership of Simonian Rugs, unaware that he was now the custodian of a nearly lost piece of textile history. For years, the formula was offered as a specialized service, protecting countless heirlooms and everyday items. It wasn’t until 2024, at a rug cleaning convention, that Austin realized just how rare the solution had become. Colleagues from across the country described their reliance on physical methods and scented repellents—none had access to the odorless, effective formula that Simonian Rugs had quietly preserved.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/609/498/8b6a66abb6bfd23677baf1538fde1de1_original.jpg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1771119798&amp;width=4032&amp;sig=Yb%2F%2BjKLdkXR5WZnT6uR4PflXlhoUiQ%2BkYvglzDB%2Bkhc%3D\" data-id=\"52609498\">",
                "Recognizing a unique opportunity, Austin set out to bring the solution to the public. Woolle was born—a brand with a modern identity, designed to make mothproofing accessible, safe, and effective for everyone. With a carefully chosen color palette (dark blue, white, and salmon) and thoughtfully designed kits, Woolle empowers consumers to protect their woolen treasures at home. Each kit includes a gallon of mothproofing spray, a funnel for mixing concentrate with distilled water, and a fine-mist spray bottle for easy application.",
                "Before announcing Woolle to the public, we wanted to ensure that our solution would be safe for homes, families, and treasured garments. Here’s what we found:",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Ammonium silicofluoride</span> (also known as ammonium fluorosilicate), with the formula (NH₄)₂SiF₆, is a white, water-soluble crystalline powder. It’s non-staining, odorless, and has a long history of safe use in textile care when properly diluted.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Origin:</span> Industrially, ammonium silicofluoride is produced by reacting ammonia with hexafluorosilicic acid—a byproduct of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing. Historically, it could also be found as a secondary byproduct in the ash from burning coal or from volcanic activity, where natural minerals react to form similar compounds.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Safety:</span> When diluted for textile use, ammonium silicofluoride is considered low-toxicity, non-combustible, and safe for home environments. It does not leave harmful residues or odors. We have verified its safety profile through reputable sources, including PubChem, CAMEO Chemicals, and industry literature.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Effectiveness:</span> The compound works by dehydrating moth larvae, disrupting their lifecycle and preventing damage to wool, cashmere, and other animal-based fibers. Its water solubility allows for easy, even application on garments and rugs.",
                "We chose this formula because it offers the best combination of safety, effectiveness, and ease of use. Woolle is gentle on your favorite sweaters and heirloom rugs—giving you peace of mind and real protection without harsh chemicals or lingering scents.",
                "Woolle stands as a testament to the power of tradition, innovation, and family stewardship. For over a century, the secrets of effective mothproofing were nearly lost—buried by corporate mergers, forgotten by changing industries, and safeguarded by a handful of dedicated practitioners. Today, Woolle revives this legacy, offering a proven, non-toxic, and water-based solution to a new generation of textile lovers.",
                "Through Woolle, the world’s woolen treasures can once again be protected—just as they were in the golden age of New York’s textile boom. The lost solution has found its way home.",

                "It all started with a rescue pup named Cookie who immediately had a name change to Queen (Q). Named after the most powerful piece on the chess board, I never knew it would have such a strong resemblance to her personality. Strong, spoiled, powerful, and well..a Queen.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;Queen grew up \"off leash\" and constantly exploring, we often were moving around within her first few years and constantly on the go. We settled in a town North of Miami, where when I would walk Q off leash I often was getting a lot of negative feedback. However she never left my side, bothered anyone, and was always well behaved I didn't think she deserved to have to be tied to 3 feet directly to my hand. We enjoyed roller blading, bike riding, beach runs all without the need of a leash. &nbsp;",
                "Then came the time, where we just had to be on a leash - I started to find a way to give her the freedom I wanted her to have, until we got to where we were going to set her free. It started with cheap 'hands free' leashes with bad designs, inexpensive packs, constantly getting loose or not fitting correctly, falling off my waist, not stylish. I didn't think there was much in the market for me. After brainstorming, coming up with some ideas and a LOT of product sampling, I finally was able to create something I could use and thought was stylish.&nbsp;",
                "Prototype development began, and testing has been ongoing. I have now personally been using my prototype over a year without any issue and have slowly been working to get a product to market. Who knew how expensive being passionate about animals could be..",
                "This started as a bit of a passion project for me, and turned into something I want to be able to offer the public. An affordable, stylish, well made product with functionality to allow them a little more freedom while walking their pup. The idea is to secure some funding to build inventory, create more colors, advance some of the prototypes moving beyond just this version 1. Growing the Q Pet Products into a complete brand that offers a multitude of well thought out products making life easier for pet owners.&nbsp;",
                "This project is as close to my heart as it gets, Q and I have been together in the tightest of bonds for over 5 years now. She is the reason for the Q Leash, her and I both hope that people enjoy it as much as we have.&nbsp;"

                "The idea behind this project comes from a frustration we’ve had for years: finding a tote that could truly keep up with our lives. Most leather totes look beautiful at first sight, but when you actually live with them, their limits quickly appear. They are often too rigid, too heavy, and lock you into a fixed shape that only works some of the time. On the other hand, the more flexible options we tried were practical, but lacked the timeless style and craftsmanship that make a bag a pleasure to carry every day.",
                "In short, we were always forced to choose: either beauty without functionality, or practicality without elegance. And the more we searched, the more we felt that this compromise was unnecessary. Why couldn’t a tote be both refined and adaptive? Why couldn’t it respect tradition, yet reinvent itself for modern life?",
                "That’s when Diane was born. Instead of accepting the existing rules, we decided to create our own solution <span class=\"bold\">-</span> a tote that expands or contracts according to your needs, handcrafted in smooth leather, and rooted in Parisian originality. A bag that finally solves the frustration we had been living with for years.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">5- A fair price for true value</span><br>While other luxury brands charge <span class=\"bold\">500–1,200€</span> for comparable bags, we keep our price fair by going direct-to-consumer. No middlemen, no retail markups, just honest pricing for a premium original product.",

            "biography": "I have always been driven by creativity. From an early age, I immersed myself in the performing arts, actively participating in theatre as a thespian. The discipline of rehearsals, the intensity of stage lights, and the responsibility of conveying emotion before an audience shaped my understanding of expression and storytelling. Music has remained equally important in my life; I often return to the piano, allowing creativity to guide me, especially during challenging moments.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up across several African countries, I was exposed to a rich diversity of languages, cultures, rhythms, and traditions. These experiences profoundly influenced how I see the world and how I approach creative work. Relocating to Canada as a teenager required me to navigate a new cultural environment while preserving the depth of my heritage. A pivotal moment came when I first walked a runway. That experience awakened a new level of confidence and self-assurance, reinforcing the importance of identity and presence.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, I founded **Bold & Modern Global Culture (B&M)** in Montreal, Quebec. What began as a vision developed independently from my room—with limited resources but strong determination—has grown into a purpose-driven fashion brand. B&M blends authentic cultural influences with refined, modern streetwear design. The goal is to create pieces—hoodies, jackets, and accessories—that allow individuals to celebrate their heritage in a contemporary and empowering way.\r\n\r\nFor me, this brand is deeply personal. Each design carries a narrative, much like theatre and music. I want every person who wears B&M to feel pride in their roots, confidence in their identity, and connection to a broader global community. Beyond fashion, the brand is committed to giving back through cultural workshops and community initiatives that support creativity and self-expression.\r\n\r\nFaith remains central to my journey- God first, always.\r\n\r\nI continue to combine creativity with technical skill, coding professionally while building the future of B&M. The vision is long-term: to build something meaningful, impactful, and culturally unifying.\r\n\r\nwww.bmglobalculture.com",

My work is a bridge between the ancient wisdom of crystal energy and the clean, understated elegance of modern Canadian design.\r\n\r\nWith a deep-rooted passion for energy culture, I spent years studying the vibrational properties of minerals. I found that most spiritual jewelry was either too ornate or too heavy for a contemporary lifestyle. This led me to develop a signature style centered on 4mm micro-beads and precision-cut facets, creating pieces that feel like a delicate extension of the wearer.\r\n\r\nMy design philosophy is simple: Intention in every bead. I hand-select 7A-grade natural stones not just for their aesthetic brilliance, but for their ability to bring focus, serenity, and confidence to the modern soul. By integrating 14K Gold-Filled elements, I ensure each piece is as durable as it is beautiful—a timeless companion for your daily journey",

Brenda’s work has shaped the game industry for decades, yet her story represents something even bigger than games: <span class=\"bold\">it’s about daring to build worlds when the real one doesn’t always make space for you</span>.&nbsp;",
                "Through Theresa’s lens, we explore not just a remarkable career, but the heart, humor, and humanity behind it. <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Game On</span></span> is joyful, thoughtful, and fiercely inspiring, just like the woman at its center. Women filmmakers and women game developers have often been the hidden architects of our stories and our play. When we celebrate women who design our games and women who direct our films, we expand who gets to imagine, who gets to lead, and who gets to be remembered.",

We need your help to <span class=\"bold\">complete post-production</span> and <span class=\"bold\">jumpstart distribution and impact campaigns</span> to bring <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Game On</span></span> to the world.

                "<br>Brenda incorporates game play into every aspect of her life. She treats the board and video games she creates as an opportunity to both entertain players and amplify important social issues. Her games explore cultural histories including Black, Indigenous, Irish, Mexican and Jewish, in ways that challenge us.",

She and her husband, legendary game developer John Romero, are on a mission to do what they love while raising four kids in an ethnically-blended family. Brenda helms the production of a new game, and opens up a timely discussion about sexism in the gaming world.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/219/347/6729d67c6039f0736037ebfb6e3a52ea_original.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1768412968&amp;width=1700&amp;sig=0J%2Fm%2BPktm2CydTPhxqgOG1QOzmNzY654g1O1dfPvNow%3D\" data-id=\"52219347\">",

My goal for the film is to increase &nbsp;awareness of her contributions, magnify her impact and smash stereotypes of what women have been, are, and can be as artists and social activists. I want the public to know Barbara Dane so that they may feel empowered to take action in their own way, just as she did. That&nbsp;change can take time, but it is worth it.

                "SCP:GALLIONIC is an independent animated short film following the events after a catastrophic containment breach through the eyes of Matthew Vestergaard, a simple accountant working on the outskirts of the facility, and the events leading up to said breach through Jane Vestergaard, a young researcher at the facility and Matthew’s older sister. Jane is helplessly frustrated&nbsp;with the facility's status quo in which containment breaches seem to be a common occurrence and the loss of staff is just part of the job. She is worried this mass apathy could lead to a catastrophic containment breach and has to scramble for a solution to all of this. Matthew, on the other hand, decides to venture within the facility after said catastrophic event, with no knowledge of what happened or even what is in this place, but with the sole goal of saving his sister.",
                "The story explores theme of control over one's surroundings and selves. Whilst the story is based&nbsp;on various lore from the&nbsp; SCP wiki, <span class=\"bold\">it is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of it to fully enjoy this short</span>. If anything we hope this short gets more people curious about SCP and all that it brings!&nbsp;",
                "Working in the outskirts of the main facility as a simple accountant, Matthew passes his days in relative tranquillity, not having to bear the knowledge of what is kept within the facility. His attitude however suddenly changes when a catastrophic containment breach occurs at the site, and he together with the few who were outside of the facility are left without any information of what happened. With rescue being unavailable and the threat of the whole place self-destructing, Matthew decides to venture into the facility and find his sister, despite knowing the near impossibility of the task.",
                "As a young 29 year old researcher at site 19-2, Jane, like many others, is tasked with the observation and research of various anomalies contained within the facility. As time goes on, she witnesses multiple breaches, in which anomalies escape containment, wreaking havoc within the site and leaving many casualties. However, what shocks her the most are not the breaches in it of themselves, but everyone's seeming apathy towards them. She worries that this will lead to complacency, and sooner or later, a catastrophic breach, which could put in serious risk the entire site, if not the world at large. Therefore she desperately starts searching for a possible solution to all of this before it's too late.",
                "Virgil is a senior facility guard working on the facility's perimeter who's only job is that of making sure nothing enters the site. Despite having worked within the facility in his early days, he quickly realised he'd much prefer a calmer albeit more boring position outside, as a patrol officer. However, when finding out his friend, Matthew, was going to enter the facility alone after The catastrophic containment breach, he decides to accompany him and become his guide through the maze like structure, aiding him in finding his sister, despite knowing the risks, and that they might never come back.",
                "Jessica is a senior researcher at site 19-2 with multiple years of experience and a discrete level of authority within the site. Despite having seen many things over the years, she remains light-hearted and easy going, which seems to mesh well with Jane, as the two quickly become friends, helping out one another, leading to Jessica empathising with Jane’s sentiment, and deciding to help her in some shape or form.",

                "As the biggest and most ambitious facility, Site 19-2 was built from the ground up in an undisclosed part of Alaska with the idea of containing as many anomalies in one single place as possible. When the idea for such a site was proposed to the board it was heavily criticised for its seeming danger, as one single catastrophic breach could put at risk many thousands of anomalies. However, through thorough testing and research, both in the architecture of the facility, together with its logistics and security systems, proved it near impossible for such an event to happen.",
                "After such conclusion, what made the proposal even more appealing was the logistic and energy simplicity, as resources could be more easily concentrated in one single area instead of being spread out across multiple facilities, which made everything from resupplying to re-containment much easier.&nbsp;",
                "The facility now houses over 100'000 active personnel, and one third of all actively containable non-indestructible SCPs, which means it is much closer to a city than a laboratory. Because of it's remote and hostile location, the foundation has taken extra steps in ensuring the wellbeing and comfort of all staff, so as to reduce any unwanted psychological stress and maintain maximum efficiency.",

                "This project has been a long time coming. We've worked out the script, concept art, characters and even made a proof of concept trailer, but we now want to take it a step further, and make this project become a reality.",

                "Freddy Fazbear’s Food and Theatre is a realistic found footage horror series inspired by <a href=\"http://chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>, originally created by <a href=\"http://chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scott Cawthon</a>. I’ve been a fan of that world for a long time, and this series is basically my attempt to present it in a way that feels like these places could actually exist in real life.",
                "One of the biggest things I wanted to focus on was making the animatronics feel believable. I redesigned them from the ground up to resemble the types of stage robots that used to exist at places like Chuck E. Cheese and ShowBiz Pizza Place, while still keeping them completely original to this project. A lot of similar fan projects lean too heavily into copying those real world designs, and I really wanted to avoid that. I want these characters and this location to feel like their own thing while still feeling grounded and familiar.",
                "Right now, my plan is to create AT LEAST four episodes, each somewhere around 5 to 15 minutes long. The series is going to be told through multiple points of view, with each character having a realistic reason for filming. I’m also rewriting the story and lore almost entirely from scratch. Some names and general ideas might carry over as inspiration, but this is meant to be its own story that doesn’t rely on knowledge of the original games. Due to &nbsp;mystery being a large aspect of the story, I am unable to go in depth publicly with my exact plans for it, but do know I have 3 episodes fully scripted out and the overall narrative is no longer under development.&nbsp;",
                "This campaign is mainly about helping me fully produce the series itself. The biggest goal is being able to create these episodes at a higher quality and in a more reliable timeframe. &nbsp;The budget would be to make this series happen in the highest quality and most efficient way possible. Things like better hardware (a high fidelity gaming PC with 3D optimization in mind), blender add-ons (like auto-remesh and numerous environmental mods), as well as editing softwares that will ensure the series continues reliably and releases on time. Beyond that, I would like to give some bonuses to a few artists and voice actors who have volunteered to help me for free.&nbsp;",
                "My production workflow usually starts with writing and planning out the story and camera perspectives. From there I move into modeling characters and environments, then animation and scene layout, followed by voice acting, sound design, rendering, and final editing. I create and animate everything inside Blender, and most models in the series are built by me, with some background assets coming from BlenderKit where appropriate.",
                "As of now, the estimated production timeline starts with finishing scripts and major designs, then moving into full episode production which I expect to take several months depending on complexity. Episodes will be completed individually and released once they are finished. When production wraps, all episodes will be available publicly for free on my <a href=\"http://chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a> channel, BLOODLET_FX.",
                "Backers would be supporting the actual creation of the series and would receive rewards tied directly to the production process, like early episode access, behind-the-scenes content, digital artwork, and credits in the series depending on the support tier. These rewards would be delivered alongside episode releases as production progresses.",
                "Like any animated project, there are challenges that come with production time, rendering, learning new techniques, and coordinating with collaborators like voice actors or artists. To help manage this, I’m structuring production in stages and planning episodes in a way that lets progress continue even if certain parts take longer than expected.",
                "This project is something I’m extremely passionate about because I’ve always believed the original concept works best when it feels grounded and believable. The goal is to create a horror series that feels like real discovered footage rather than just an animated retelling. Support from this campaign would help make that possible and help bring the full series to life.",

My mission is to create a new set of heroes for today's youth, specifically for audiences aged 13 and up. I want to provide them with characters who embody \"pure good,\" serving as role models they can learn from and resonate with, just as I did as a child.",

With the advent of a newborn baby, Kevin and his wife, Lilith, can’t spare any time not working, but Kevin has to reclaim his mother’s ashes. After abandoning Lilith to take care of the baby she didn’t want in the first place to meet with his father, Kevin has to decide whether it’s more important to him to take care of his family, or honor his mother’s wishes.",

                "The director of Good Night Deborah, Jordan Wells, recognizes the importance of highlighting black talent in film, so he has elected to focus on having an all-black cast as well as filming in locations that highlight the history of black Americans."

I established my brand 'Curry Cravings (TM) LLC' in 2004 as an umbrella under which I showcase the diversity and complexity of Indian cuisine. \r\nThanks to this Kickstarter community, I've successfully published 7 cookbooks, and a novel, including the Gourmand World Cookbook Award winner, Masaleydaar: Classic Indian Spice Blends (2023).\r\n \r\nI enjoy food: experimenting with it, creating it, capturing its essence and sharing its goodness with friends – new and old.  I love all kinds of flavors. In my kitchen, I strive to create healthy and memorable eats.\r\n\r\nI draw from my cultural roots and academic background in design and the sciences and revisit them all through my inherited, all-consuming passion - food.  Food is a direct connection to a culture, to its history, to lands we may not have traveled yet, and to generations, we have never met. \r\n\r\nAnd that is why I tell the stories I do.\r\n \r\nBest wishes,\r\nNandita",

The remainder goes to everyone else. This is the way traditional publishing works. We are not doing that here.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">In contrast, my books are indie published (not vanity). They are a one-person project (or 1.5 if you count my husband). The funds raised in this campaign are allocated towards printing the book, packaging materials, and shipping expenses.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">My task list as a creator is extensive. For ‘India In A Cup’, I am responsible for the following: researching, recipe development, writing, prop styling &amp; food photography, graphic design and layout, indexing, as well as quality control, plus shipping and handling when the book is completed. For the food styling/ food photography, I am also making all the ceramics for the book and any ceramic rewards. My husband reviews and helps with the line editing and creating digital copies (for Kindle and iBooks), but after being married for 25 years, he also tests recipes, and gets paid in drinks :D In addition, I’m also taking on the necessary task of marketing and press for it, to ensure we capture the highest funding potential, find sponsors as needed to offset raw material costs during recipe testing, and reach audiences who may join the campaign later (through late pledges, only available if the campaign is successful).&nbsp;</span>",

                "“The Strip Club Chicken” brand was conceived in 2022, through 2022-2023 the brand was tested at various pop-up kitchens. The branding never failed to be a talking point.",
                "Unfortunately due to losing my father to heart failure and a subsequent diagnosis of the same hereditary heart condition i stopped tje pop ups.",
                "Fast forward to 2025 the menu has grown and been refined and we have rebranded ready to launch.&nbsp;",
                "we have been let down by 3 kitchens to date. But we have now found a permanent home in a local pub garden in which we can develop the brand further, providing quality food the regulars like to eat. Driving repeat business and helping to increase wet sales for the venue. We will also focus on our social media platforms to increase brand awareness and target the delivery market. \n",
                "Why Choose “The Strip Club”\n",
                "Chicken has continued to be a consistent demand, if anything it is still increasing in popularity. It is versatile, it has a broad customer appeal and is one of the more sustainable forms of meat derived protein. With quality ingredients, passionate chefs and the right branding “The Strip Club” offers a unique customer experience that will drive repeat business and help the brand organically grow through word of mouth. The addition of smash burgers and a good selection of sides ensure there is something for all tastes. \n",
                "“The Strip Club” is not a chicken shop. It is a brand. A brand we are looking to grow organically with the view to opening further branches run by trusted staff trained in our original and flagship kitchen. With the ultimate goal being franchises. &nbsp;In addition, we will also be donating some of our profits to helping local families and causes that need support through our Fund The Flock initiative. &nbsp; \n",
                "Unfortunately, &nbsp;due &nbsp;to being let down by previous kitchens we had not budgeted for a self contained container kitchen. So we need to find £6000 in order to purchase one. We have sourced a suitable kitchen. We just need to raise the finances. &nbsp;\n"

It's been truly humbling and we feel right at home!",

We can't wait to get the doors open again and show you all the changes. We've also branched out into event catering so preparing the back of house area to be fit to take on this extra work has been key to our plans. This is all, already, well under way.&nbsp;",
                "So why a crowd fund? Well we have more to tell you! We have taken the keys to another site. Scary stuff! But very exciting! We can see the new site from Hiraeth's front door which is perfect. We want to bring a quality space for people to enjoy that will complement Hiraeth and Victoria Park. We love a pub, always have. So we are bringing a Tap House to Victoria Park. The Pig &amp; Swill is coming!",
                "To deliver all that we have planned we need your help. We'll, as always, be rolling up our sleeves, dusting off the power tools and getting stuck into this ourselves. We don't shy away from the hard work. We just need a little bit of financial help to get this completed.&nbsp;",

                "We're putting the money towards the fit out of the trading area. We've got walls to plaster, floors to put down, paint, blinds, furniture, a bar to build, toilet to put in, a cellar to build and plenty more!",

                "If you’ve ever found yourself happier with people around your table than anywhere else on earth, this book is for you.",
                "Third Course: Always Tonight at 7.30 is the third in my series of family cookbooks, celebrating life around our table in two places we love: London (with endless friends and our daughter and her circle) and Connecticut (at Red Gate Farm, surrounded by friends as well but also family: my wonderful mom, my sister and her family). It’s a book of recipes, yes, but also a collection of stories to help us remember the communities we’ve gathered in both countries, and the way food threads through all our days.",
                "But this book was never meant to be! A THIRD volume?&nbsp; Yes, I said I wouldn’t!",
                "In 2012 I began writing what I called “the cookbook, ”Tonight at 7.30: One Family’s Life at the Table, \"the\" because there was never going to be a second one (#novolumetwo). That first book launched in 2015, with my husband John beside me, and our daughter Avery Curran, then 18, having taken the brilliant photographs for the book and generally having been my partner in crime.",
                "Of course, I immediately started cooking new things. #novolumetwo became Second Helpings, shaped by friends and family, by the pandemic years, and by the kind of collective encouragement that keeps a home cook brave. &nbsp;This was Avery's swansong as my food photographer, and what a brilliant job she did, often photographing two meals in one day, to make this book as beautiful as it is.",
                "And now here we are, at Third Course, older, busier, still setting the table, still always aiming for dinner at 7.30.",
                "In this newest book, you’ll become acquainted with our idiosyncratic life under a giant railway arch, you’ll get to know the aisles of our local Turkish shop where everyone calls me “darling,” and the children in my Friday Cooking Club will be among your close friends when you read the chapter about our adventures. Life is made a lot more interesting with Plan Zheroes, our food-surplus charity at Borough Market, and this new book celebrates no-waste cooking like never before.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">WHAT THIS BOOK IS (AND ISN’T)</span>",
                "This is not a book of fussy cheffiness. I’m not a precise cook (except when baking frightens me into obedience). My recipes are meant to be flexible: adjusted to suit what’s in your fridge, what’s in season, who’s coming for supper and what they long to eat. The recipes range from simple to more complex, and they’re influenced by the wonderfully diverse cooks and food writers I’ve learned from over the years.",
                "“Third Course” is also a book with a sense of humour about real life in the kitchen. If you’ve followed me online, you’ll know I’m as likely to share the disasters as the triumphs, because cooking becomes so much more enjoyable when you stop feeling you must be perfect. Oh, the times I’ve poured long-simmered chicken stock through a sieve and directly down the kitchen drain!&nbsp; Or how about the time when I made an elaborate Tom Yum soup paste – garlic, ginger, lemongrass, chillies, coriander and so much more – only to leave it behind in my food processor and feed my guests a soup that was nothing more or less than chicken broth and coconut milk with some mushrooms floating on top.&nbsp; No one noticed until we did the dishes and discovered the processor full of fragrant paste? Ah, well, I’m human. And for every disaster, there are innumerable delicious successes.&nbsp; Like creamy, spicy daal. Or a heavenly chocolate babka, perfect for celebrating something special.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">WHAT’S INSIDE</span>",
                "Third Course is organised into the sections I most often reach for when I’m feeding people I love: soups, poultry, meat, fish and seafood, pasta, salads and vegetables, sauces, dressings, dips and rubs, sweet things and baked goods, snacks, and a final section close to my heart: Kristen’s Cooking Club.",

                "Unlike my two previous books which were beloved collaborations with my daughter Avery, for Third Course, the photographs are mine. They capture the food, but also the rooms we eat in, the art on the walls behind a plate, and the very real characters who wander through my kitchen. That includes two new, impossibly fluffy family members, Betsy and Tony, who appear more than once (and who have, I regret to report, been known to “help” from the countertop).",
                "<span class=\"bold\">THE PANTRY UNDER THE RAILWAY ARCH</span>",
                "Our London home is… unusual. We live under a railway arch, and for the first time in my life I have a “pantry,\" which is to say: a ground-floor room that became the storage heart of the house, scented with spices and filled with marmalade, plates, bowls, and all the little tricks of my trade. It’s also occasionally a guest bedroom, because life is like that. You’ll see glimpses of it throughout the book.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">KRISTEN’S COOKING CLUB</span>",
                "One of the joys of my life over the past decade has been teaching children to cook at local primary schools. The Cooking Club section of Third Course includes child-friendly recipes that work even with very young helpers, plus stories from Friday afternoons that are full of shenanigans, sweetness, and accidental wisdom. It’s one of the parts of the book I’m proudest of, because it’s as much about building confidence and kindness as it is about food.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">WHY KICKSTARTER</span>",
                "Kickstarter is the way I love launching these books as a shared event. It gathers the community first, lets me print responsibly, and keeps the process personal, from the first announcement to the final package landing on your doorstep. Kickstarter funds will not only help create the book, but it will make distribution a dream. This book truly becomes a team effort.",
                "If you back this project, you’re not just pre-ordering a book. You’re helping me get a beautiful object into the world (and into kitchens), and you’re joining the circle of people who make my work possible.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">REWARDS (A QUICK GUIDE)</span>",
                "I’ve kept the rewards straightforward and genuinely useful:",
                "• $10: four extra dinner-party recipes (appetiser, main, side, dessert) delivered as a beautiful printable page.<br>• $15: a gorgeous PDF edition.<br>• $30: a first-edition copy shipped to the US or UK + the PDF.<br>• $45: a first-edition copy shipped anywhere outside the US/UK.<br>• Multi-book bundles for gifting (2, 4, or 8 copies).<br>• A signed first-edition + an apron with original artwork (+ PDF).<br>• The “come to supper” rewards: dinner for six at Red Gate Farm (Connecticut) or in London, plus signed books and textiles.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">THANK YOU</span>",
                "Thank you for reading, sharing, and cooking alongside me. I’m grateful for the friends and family who taste-test, tell the truth, turn up hungry, and keep showing me that a table, set with love, can still be the best place to be."

And now we want to thank all of you—newcomers and veterans alike—with an incredible <span class=\"bold\">ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME</span> <span class=\"bold\">EVENT </span>AND <span class=\"bold\">30th Anniversary Celebration book!</span>",
                "Let's start with the book! Inside this lavish tome we'll share the <span class=\"bold\">whole story of Deadlands, </span>show off the work of all the incredible artists we've partnered with, tell you what happened <span class=\"bold\">behind the scenes</span> of various projects<span class=\"bold\">,</span> share some of our <span class=\"bold\">best convention stories,</span> bemoan the tale of various <span class=\"bold\">Deadlands video game and movie attempts,</span> repeat the famous first edition forewords from beloved authors <span class=\"bold\">Joe Lansdale,</span> <span class=\"bold\">Mike Stackpole,</span> and actor <span class=\"bold\">Bruce Campbell,</span> AND even tell you about the time <span class=\"bold\">Bruce played</span> <span class=\"bold\">in a live-action version of Deadlands!</span> The book also features a complete <span class=\"bold\">cover gallery</span> of most everything we've ever made, displays the covers of our many licenses and foreign translations, AND gives you a <span class=\"bold\">sneak peek at what's to come!</span>",
                "And since <span class=\"bold\">YOU are part of the Deadlands story,</span> every person who backs the book <span class=\"bold\">gets their name IN the book!</span> If it's in your Reward tier OR you add it separately, we'll contact you before it's printed to see what name you want in the Special Thanks page. Feel free to <span class=\"bold\">name a loved one,</span> posse member, or your own \"Western\" name...like <span class=\"bold\">Simon \"One Eye\" Lucas or Jodi \"Crit Fail Queen\" Black!</span>",

Click the image above for the details!",

But an anniversary shouldn’t only look back. It should look to the trail ahead.",
                "Alongside this celebration, we’re introducing a <span class=\"bold\">new, fully self-contained Deadlands roleplaying game core book with the Savage Worlds rules built in and reflavored just for the Weird West! </span>The book also includes the character-facing material from the Deadlands Companion like Witches, US Marshals, and the Metal Mage Edge.",

The rest of those from the existing core book have been separated out into a new bestiary AND relic book called <span class=\"text-italic\">Rascals, Varmints, &amp; Relics.</span> This paves the way for <span class=\"bold\">brand new bestiaries and relic books</span>—something we haven't done in a long time and are super excited about doing again!",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">If you already own Deadlands and Savage Worlds, you DON'T NEED to buy these new versions.</span> </span>There are two small updates in this new edition that we'll be giving you for free right on our website (we updated Dueling rules and there's a small clarification on Chases).",
                "If you've been with us for a while and want a treat, take a look at the <span class=\"bold\">one-time-only red leather version</span> of the new combined core rules!",
                "As we did with <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Pathfinder® for Savage Worlds,</span></span> we want to make sure that <span class=\"bold\">when someone NEW discovers Deadlands for the first time</span>—next year, or ten years from now—everything they need to play is in <span class=\"bold\">one book.</span>",
                "The Savage Worlds model of one rule book, one setting book will continue for our other lines, but <span class=\"bold\">our flagship setting is a gateway</span> to bring more amazing people into our community. Keep right on playing with your existing Savage Worlds Adventure Edition and Deadlands setting book, or pick up the new combined book if that's better for your posse.",
                "We wanted to reward those of you who <span class=\"bold\">help us</span> bring this new combined core book to life, so these are <span class=\"bold\">Kickstarter campaign exclusive prices.</span> The price for several of the items, including the core, will be higher afterward. (The new core book, for example, is $50 here but will retail for $60.)",
                "And the<span class=\"bold\"> 30th Anniversary rewards </span>in this campaign <span class=\"bold\">are exclusive!</span> We'll produce enough for our backers and any extras may show up at conventions, but they won't become ongoing stock items, so <span class=\"bold\">when they're gone, they're gone.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">If you’ve been with us for years,</span> this is your chance to celebrate three decades of the Weird West with something meaningful and commemorative. <span class=\"bold\">We recommend the limited edition 30th Anniversary Celebration </span>reward, <span class=\"bold\">OR the Veteran of the Weird West </span>reward if you want the gorgeous red leather bound rule book, too<span class=\"bold\">.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">If you’re new,</span> this is the best starting point Deadlands has ever had. The items in the Kickstarter will be more expensive later on, so if you're thinking of saddling up, <span class=\"bold\">we recommend the Deadlands Marshal Basic </span>or<span class=\"bold\"> Plus</span> rewards, or<span class=\"bold\"> Deadlands All </span>In if you're ready to bite the bullet!",
                "Either way, <span class=\"bold\">thank</span> <span class=\"bold\">you </span>for being part of the past, present, and future of Deadlands!",
                "The new <span class=\"bold\">Deadlands core rules</span> contain the latest edition of the Savage Worlds core rules and everything you need to play, including all the original Arcane Backgrounds and those from the previous Deadlands Companion (including US Marshals, Witches, and Voodooists), and a bestiary of the most important varmints and critters. That includes over a dozen common nonplayer characters, common animals like horses, snakes, swarms, and over a dozen of Deadlands' signature abominations!",
                "A new bestiary called <span class=\"bold\">Rascals, Varmints, &amp; Relics</span> includes all the additional creatures from the previous Deadlands setting book and updated profiles for important characters from the now out-of-print <span class=\"text-italic\">Deadlands Companion,</span> along with <span class=\"bold\">updated profiles for the Servitors</span> (even those the posse may have dealt with in the Servitor series of adventures). It also includes all the Relics from the previous Deadlands setting book.&nbsp;",
                "Putting all this into a new book keeps the core at a manageable size (332 amazing pages!) and opens the door for future bestiaries just like we've done with <span class=\"text-italic\">Pathfinder for Savage Worlds! </span>This one is currently at the 144 page mark, but we won't have a final page count till we get all our artists' incredible illustrations in there.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Marshal's Accessories</span> box is a fantastic aid for the Game Master. It includes an Action Deck (oversized so the cards are easier to read around a table) featuring some of the best of Deadlands artwork, die-cut cardboard status tokens, Bennies, and Conviction tokens, a gorgeous GM's screen (three 10.25\" x 6.5\" panels so you can see over it, Marshal!), a set of dice the color of glistening ghost rock, five dials to track ammo or Power Points, a large poster map of the Weird West, and some handy reference cards for your players!",
                "We're also offering up something brand new with this release! A <span class=\"bold\">Powers</span> box that contains reference card SETS for all the Arcane Backgrounds in Deadlands. That includes the blessed, chi master, huckster, mad scientist, shaman, voodooist, and witch! You get a set of cards for EACH of these character types, all on their own beautifully designed graphic background!",
                "For the first time ever, we've created a <span class=\"bold\">DEADLANDS STARTER BOX</span> for brand new Marshals! This gorgeous boxed set contains a \"Showcase\" version of the rules, a complete adventure called <span class=\"text-italic\">The Cursed Caverns,</span> maps, tokens, pawns, Action Deck, Bennies, Templates, AND Archetype cards!",
                "We've even got a special offering for those grizzled gunslingers who've seen a thing or two along the dark frontier. The Veteran of the Weird West reward includes everything in the Celebration bundle (the<span class=\"bold\"> 30th Anniversary Celebration book</span>, the <span class=\"bold\">Huckster Dice</span>, and the <span class=\"bold\">Conviction Coins</span>), PLUS a <span class=\"bold\">special, signed, leatherbound version</span> of the new combined <span class=\"text-italic\">Savage Worlds</span> and <span class=\"text-italic\">Deadlands </span>core rules!",
                "If you want an extra copy of one of these new or limited items, or if you want to fill in some holes in your collection, you'll be able to add the following items to your pledge <span class=\"bold\">once you've chosen your reward level.</span> Everything will be shipped as a single package, which lets you benefit from <span class=\"bold\">lower campaign shipping rates, especially for overseas backers.</span>&nbsp;",
                "Of course, you can also just order the older items direct from our new web store and get them delivered right away!",
                "The products in this campaign are written and playtested. Your support allows us to help boost the signal to other fans—by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours.",
                "We deliver the first PDF a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter. &nbsp;This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding.",
                "After the Kickstarter ends, we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and then collect shipping once the product is on its way from the printer. You can&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">upgrade</span>&nbsp;your pledge or include more&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Add-Ons</span>&nbsp;in your order while the pledge manager is open.",
                "Shipping prices are changing rapidly in the current climate, and despite our best efforts global supply chains remain volatile. Given all that's going on in the world, providing an estimate of the rates now rather than closer to shipping is nothing more than a guess.",
                "Our long-time friends Studio 2 will handle all domestic shipping, and we continue to work hard to build relationships with partners around the world. Backers should see costs&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">closer to local rates,</span>&nbsp;and orders to the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia will be&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Customs friendly.</span>",
                "Since we can't tell you what those rates will be yet, any backer who wishes can downgrade their pledge to the nearest digital option once the rates are established and we'll refund the difference—no questions asked.",
                "Any Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">info@peginc.com</span>.",
                "By backing this campaign, you consent to receive emails from @peginc.com and @kickstarter.com email addresses for purposes of fulfilling your pledge, updates, and announcements.&nbsp;<br><br>All backers will also be subscribed to the weekly Pinnacle Newsletter which features on-going micro updates for all our outstanding crowdfunding campaigns.

If your country does not fall into one of these regions you may incur any additional import fees/duties as applicable by your local legislation. We will send games to our partner warehouses in these regions in order to keep the shipping costs as low as possible for you. Any other region will be fulfilled from the closest hub to your country.

However, due to the fluid and unpredictable tariff situation in the US, we must reserve the right to request an additional shipping charge. This charge will be based on the actual production and import costs of your pledge level. To ensure fairness, it will only be calculated and collected closer to the delivery date, when the exact charges are known.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Malta backers: </span>We offer a Free Shipping option for Maltese backers who want to pick up their game(s) from our office in Malta.

                "There are four new DnD 5E mechanics that <span class=\"text-italic\">Altheya: The Dragon Empire</span> adds to your games, to make your adventures across Ilmera even more epic and heroic.",
                "Harness fate to twist your luck. At the start of the session, the players and GM each roll a d6: on 1–3 it goes to the GM’s pool, on 4–6 it goes to the players’ pool. Anyone can spend a die from their side’s pool to gain a buff or trigger a special feature. When you spend a die, it passes to the other side though, so choose your moment wisely.",
                "Fragments of the Crown (the shattered god prison floating above Altheya) sometimes fall to earth. This 'crownsteel' is illegal to harvest, but that doesn't stop power-hungry artificers and adventurers seeking it out. Weapons and armour forged from crownsteel grant immense strength, but be warned, the material can corrupt or mutate its user.",
                "Uncover brand-new Relics, magic items that harness the world's magic to grow more powerful. Each begins at Tier 1, but can rise to Tier 2 or 3 by completing extraordinary in-world achievements. For example, a dragon-bone mace might only upgrade after being plunged into the lava of a treacherous Caldran volcano.",
                "The wilds of Ilmera are vast and unknown. With these travel rules, choose a Leader to guide each leg of the journey and everyone else takes a role like Quartermaster, Lookout and more. Each role shapes the skill challenges and encounters you face. You won’t need to role-play every day on the road, instead, travel unfolds quickly with meaningful choices and tense moments along the way.",
                "There are enough magic items in the book to fill an arch-dragon's hoard. From Uncommon gear your party might pilfer from a noble, to Relics that lie within the most heavily defended protomagi vaults. Take a look at some featured magic items below.",
                "Battlefield-focused consumables used by soldiers, mercenaries and adventurers alike. With a Bonus Action, weapons or ammunition gain elemental damage for a full minute.",
                "A mark of favour from a dragon noble, recognised across the Empire and backed by imperial records. The ring enhances social influence and grants a spell tied directly to the dragon host who issued it, making it as politically powerful as it is magical.",
                "Weapons and armour forged from crownsteel grant exceptional benefits, such as enhanced ability checks, saving throws and combat effectiveness. But, crownsteel is corrupting. Characters who use crownsteel items must bear its curse, which could lead to horrifying mutations, flaws and even shifts in ability scores over time. Crownsteel items are powerful, but come at a dreadful cost.",
                "Altheya is inhabited by all kinds of dangerous fantasy creatures. That's without mentioning the horrors that emerge from protomagi vaults, the cultists who transform themselves in new and wicked ways, and the abominations birthed by the Embered Gods. The book features all-new stat blocks to use in your games. Take a look at some featured monsters below:",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Awoken</span> don't just buy, steal and hunt for protomagi relics – they consume them. These humanoid creatures have lost every shred of their humanity, and have fully given over to their greed and lust for powerful magic. Approach with extreme caution.",
                "Relentless insectoids who live in the deep, dark places of the world. <span class=\"bold\">Belamorphs</span> can smell minerals from miles away, then they dig towards them, devour them, and feed them to their queen. Their love of precious metals makes them a blight for adventurers and merchants alike.",
                "Powerful nobles like <span class=\"bold\">Duke Ignarious</span> (pictured above) own huge swathes of land, given to them by their province's arch-dragon. These immense dragons have the ability to grant favours, deeds or magic items to over-achieving adventurers. Each noble is formidable, and can appear in either humanoid or dragon form.",
                "The book introduces <span class=\"bold\">two brand-new subclasses </span>that players can utilise when creating their next character – and SIX more unlocked by stretch goals! They have been crafted specially for the world of Altheya, but will work in any fantasy setting.",

                "<br>&nbsp;SUTEGOMA: BAD BLOOD is a fast-paced survival horror game blending old school game mechanics with the polish of modern horror - think Pacman meets Outlast.<br><br>You wake up inside an unknown facility with no memories - and a deep wound on your arm that won’t stop bleeding.&nbsp;<br>Gold surrounds you, and so do three, very hungry demonic sisters.&nbsp;<br>They watch. They stalk. They play. They devour.<br>Every second costs blood.&nbsp;<br>Every coin tempts you to stay longer.&nbsp;<br>Every run forces a choice: secure what you’ve earned, or risk everything for more.&nbsp;<br>You might die again, and die again, and again, and again, but don’t worry - you’ll either learn to fight back or to enjoy the bliss of submission.<br>And next time, if you’re skilled or greedy enough, you might make it out not just alive, but rich.",
                "<br>You already met Renra in the teaser. She insists she’s the oldest - even though all three were born at the same moment.<br>They no longer remember the names they once had.<br>Their Father does, but he accepts what they became.<br>After all, he was the first one to give up his own name, then his humanity and his soul.<br>Anything that would keep them from dying.<br>When his money wasn’t enough to save them, he turned to the devil.<br>The sickness stopped, but it was replaced with something much more sinister.<br>Before all of this, they were regular girls - dreaming of fame, love and a career.<br>They are immortal now, and even though they don’t need to eat, they yearn for human blood and flesh.<br>He built the facility for them.<br>But because his own blood was never good enough for them, he invited You.<br><br>You’ll meet Miora and Kanera very, very soon.",
                "<br>Some of you know me as a 2D commission artist on X (Brassica). But game development has been my dream since childhood.<br>I never wanted to only illustrate ideas, I always wanted to create experiences.<br>SUTEGOMA is my attempt to combine modern visual quality with the kind of “gamey” design I grew up loving. Games where mechanics mattered. Where difficulty wasn’t optional. Where You had to beat the game rather than merely finish it.",
                "Everything in the teaser - including the smartwatch HUD - exists in-engine and is built by me. I’ve been working on this project since september, learning, iterating, and refining as I go.<br>As all platforms crack down on content creators, and illustrators like me grow tired of competing with AI, I choose game design as my next step, and I hope you can help make my dream come true!",
                "I know there’s not a lot of gameplay visible yet, but i chose to focus on building it, rather than making it pretty - but once this campaign is live, I’ll get back to development and do my best to showcase some work-in-progress gameplay on <a href=\"https://x.com/DeathGangDev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a>&nbsp;",

The group is led by songwriters Julie and Dave Huebner—with Taylor Phillips on bass and Fernando Serna on drums. Dave’s signature cello playing is often woven into the band’s four-part harmonies, creating a distinctive sound. They released their self-titled debut album in 2016, followed by Postcard Town in 2017, Cheers to Solitude in 2020 and It's a Complicated Life in 2023.",

Born into a multicultural environment and shaped by the edges of urban life, I’ve always moved between worlds: technology and art, structure and intuition, clarity and intensity. My work grows from that intersection.\r\nFor more than two decades, I’ve built complex digital systems, designed brands, and created music that blends emotional depth with technical precision. Whether I’m producing electronic textures, writing spoken‑word pieces, or shaping visual identities, my focus is always the same: authenticity, resonance, and a sense of inner truth.\r\nMusic has been a constant companion throughout my life — a place where I can translate experience into sound. Over the years I’ve released projects across alternative electronic music, experimental hip hop, and atmospheric sound design.",

They’re in the middle of recording their next album with legendary producer Ron Rogers in Wales, UK — and now they need the support of their community to bring this music to the world. Be part of making it happen!\r\n\r\nThis  husband and wife duo hails from Austin, Texas. You can hear their Texas roots in all they do.  This high energy duo is famous for their top notch songwriting, breathtaking harmonies, and exceptional live performance.  Their latest album You Drive Me Crazy was selected to be on the 2017 first round Grammy Ballot and has taken them on tour around the US, UK, New Zealand and EU.  From Stuart Adamson's outstanding lead guitar work and gritty vocals to Hilary Claire Adamson's powerhouse vocal gymnastics and lilting harmonies, it is no wonder this duo is quickly gaining momentum both at home and abroad.  They combine the best of Texas country, southern blues, folk and gospel to create an original sound that is all their own.",

            "biography": "I’m Dani — a Wisconsin photographer, mother, and legacy storyteller, and the founder of Dani Marie Photography. I began photographing weddings because I was drawn to beginnings — the moment a family starts. Over time, that work naturally grew into family and legacy portraiture, where I now spend most of my time preserving the relationships and histories that unfold after those beginnings.\r\n\r\nAcross the years, I’ve created albums and portraits that have become part of family life — displayed on walls, held by children, and passed down. I’ve seen how photographs move from being “pictures” into becoming memory anchors, storykeepers, and heirlooms. That transformation is what defines my work.\r\n\r\nMy approach has always centered on connection over perfection. I photograph how families actually are with each other — the closeness, the belonging, the quiet emotion — and then translate those moments into tangible artwork designed to last far beyond digital files or trends.\r\n\r\nAs Dani Marie Photography has grown, so has the vision: a dedicated legacy portrait studio where families can gather, be photographed intentionally, and celebrate their story through reveal and artwork experiences. Through this Kickstarter, I’m building the Dani Marie Legacy Portrait Studio and inviting families to become founding supporters of a space created entirely for preserving what matters most — the people we love and the stories we share across generations.",

You can wipe it before you leave, but when you pull into daycare in the dark, you’re stuck getting out again just to park safely. I tried hydrophobic covers and ceramic coatings—both useless. Then I noticed luxury cars had this built in. I wanted a simple retrofit: no drilling, no wiring, just a standalone unit that lasts all winter and refills like washer fluid. Lens Lizard is the result—and honestly, it’s a blast to use.",
