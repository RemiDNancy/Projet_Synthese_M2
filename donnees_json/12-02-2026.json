We come from different walks of life, shaped by different trades, experiences, and perspectives, but we found one another through a shared love for symbolism, art, and the quiet magic of tarot.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t begin with a grand plan. What started as conversations, sketches, and late-night ideas slowly grew into something real. Each of our decks is born from life itself, moments we’ve lived through, things we’ve observed, emotions we couldn’t quite put into words. Every deck carries its own meaning and stories, shaped by personal experiences and the world around us.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we’ve faced many hiccups and uncertainties, creative doubts, production challenges, and times when we weren’t sure if we were on the right path. Being an indie studio means learning as we go, often through trial and error.\r\n\r\nKickstarter changed everything for us. The encouragement, patience, and sweet appreciation from our backers truly overwhelmed us. Your kind messages and belief in our work gave us the courage and energy to keep moving forward, even when things felt difficult.\r\n\r\nWe create tarot decks with care, intention, and deep respect for symbolism. We’re still growing, still learning, but we’re incredibly grateful to be on this journey together and even more grateful to share it with such a supportive community.\r\n\r\nThank you for believing in small creators and for helping us continue, one card at a time.",

                "To truly understand this deck &amp; charms, you must understand its soul: <span class=\"bold\">螺鈿 (Luódiàn)</span>, the ancient Chinese art of mother-of-pearl inlay.",
                "The art of Luódiàn, the luminous inlay of mother-of-pearl,&nbsp;Its origins are recorded as early as <span class=\"bold\">1500 BC</span>, in the twilight of the Xia Dynasty and dawn of the Shang.",
                "For over <span class=\"bold\">3,500 years</span>, Chinese artisans have performed this alchemy. They took luminous shell, believed to be <span class=\"bold\">“frozen moonlight”</span>, the very essence of intuitive <span class=\"text-italic\">yin</span> energy, and inlaid it into objects of sacred power. This was never mere decoration; it was a spiritual philosophy: <span class=\"bold\">the art of breaking a whole to create a new, more radiant whole.</span>",
                "Over this vast timeline, the craft reached its zenith of refinement over <span class=\"bold\">1,200 years ago</span> in the Tang Dynasty, becoming a treasure of the imperial court.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Now, for the first time, this ancient light, a legacy spanning three and a half millennia, meets the tarot.</span>",
                "What we love most about mother-of-pearl is how it’s made. It forms slowly, layer by layer, inside a shell, often as a response to irritation or pressure. Over time, what could have stayed rough or hidden turns into something luminous. And even then, it never looks the same twice. <span class=\"bold\">It changes depending on the light, the angle, the moment.</span>",
                "That felt instantly familiar to us, because tarot works in a very similar way.",
                "Tarot doesn’t give everything away at once. You grow into it. You revisit the same cards years later and see something completely different. Not because the card changed, but because you did. <span class=\"bold\">Meaning layers itself over time, shaped by experience, intuition, and reflection.</span>",
                "That’s why mother-of-pearl belongs at the heart of <span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot</span>.",
                "The pearlescent effect in this deck isn’t just there to look beautiful <span class=\"text-italic\">(though we won’t pretend that doesn’t matter)</span>. It’s there to remind you that meaning shifts. That nothing is fixed. That how you hold the card, and where you are in your own life, changes what you see.",
                "For collectors, this deck isn’t just something to own, it’s something to live with. Something that feels different in your hands over time. <span class=\"bold\">A deck that holds light, story, and intention quietly, without needing to announce itself.</span>",
                "And honestly, that’s exactly what we wanted it to be.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">A shift in light, a change in sight.</span><br>Pearlescent Tarot is a symbol-focused deck designed for slow, intuitive reading. As the cards catch the light, their meaning shifts—inviting you to see each symbol differently depending on the moment, the question, and where you are in your journey.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Major Arcana</span> in Pearlescent Tarot is a mirror rather than a map, offering timeless archetypal energy without prescribing a single path—allowing each reader to discover their own journey within the symbols.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Suit of Cups</span> speaks in quiet emotional language. Through symbolic forms rather than scenes, these cards explore feelings, intuition, relationships, and the inner world, without fixing them into a single story.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Suit of Pentacles</span> speaks to the tangible side of life—work, stability, growth, and the rhythms of the physical world. Expressed through symbols rather than scenes, these cards focus on what is built slowly through care, effort, and time.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Suit of Swords</span> explores the realm of thought, truth, and clarity. Through symbolic forms rather than scenes, these cards reflect the mind—its questions, conflicts, insights, and moments of sharp understanding.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Suit of Wands </span>carries the spark of movement, intention, and inner fire. Expressed through symbols rather than scenes, these cards speak to inspiration, direction, creativity, and the energy that sets things in motion.",
                "Mother-of-pearl is all about patience, gentleness, and layers formed over time. It doesn’t rush, and it doesn’t try to shine all at once. Pandas are kind of the same. They move slowly, deliberately, and without urgency. They’re strong, but soft about it. Calm, but resilient.",
                "The way the pandas cling to the branches, sometimes upright, sometimes upside down, mirrors how mother-of-pearl catches light differently depending on how you look at it. A small shift in angle changes everything. There’s no single “correct” view, just different moments revealing different sides.",
                "Together, the panda and the pearlescent idea remind us that tarot doesn’t need force or intensity to be meaningful. Wisdom can be gentle. Growth can be quiet. And sometimes, the most beautiful insights appear when you slow down enough to notice the shimmer.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot</span> comes housed in a top and bottom lid box designed to feel just as special as what’s inside.",
                "When closed, it’s quiet and elegant, dark and protective. When opened, the box reveals an inner world of colour, pattern, and symbolism, almost like opening a small treasure chest made just for the deck. We wanted the box to feel intentional, not just functional. Something sturdy, satisfying to open and close, and beautiful enough to keep on your shelf or table.&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">To us, a box It’s not just about packaging.</span><br>It’s the first moment of the experience and the place the journey returns to when you’re done.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot doesn’t stop at reading.</span>",
                "As we worked with the deck, we kept wondering what happens when tarot isn’t something you simply interpret, but something you <span class=\"text-italic\">move through</span>? When symbols don’t just sit on the table, but guide you from one moment to the next?",
                "That question led us somewhere unexpected.",
                "And it’s where the journey truly begins : <span class=\"bold\">The Pearlescent Tarot Quest</span>",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot Quest</span> came from a simple question we kept asking ourselves:<br><span class=\"text-italic\">What if tarot wasn’t something you just read… but something you could step into?</span>",
                "There’s no pressure to “get it right,” no winning or losing, and no rush. Some sessions might feel playful and light, others quiet and thoughtful. Both are exactly as they should be.",
                "You can play the Quest on your own, as a small ritual or moment of reset, or share it with others and let conversations unfold naturally. You don’t need tarot knowledge or gaming experience, just a willingness to follow curiosity and see where it leads.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What's Included in the Quest Set:</span>",
                "We wanted the Quest to feel tactile and grounding, so every piece was chosen with care.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Velvet Quest Cloth (500x500mm)</span><br>Soft and grounding, this cloth creates a small space just for the journey, something that signals it’s time to slow down.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">4 Copper Tokens</span><br>Used to mark progress, choices, or moments along the path. Simple, weighty, and satisfying to hold.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Tiger’s Eye Crystal Dice</span><br>A stone long associated with focus and protection, adding a gentle element of chance and direction.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Tiger’s Eye Crystal Dice (approx. 220x200mm)</span><br>A stone long associated with focus and protection, adding a gentle element of chance and direction.",
                "The Quest doesn’t replace <span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot</span>, it complements it.<br>The deck and the charms speak the same symbolic language: one on paper, the other in your hands. Together, they offer two ways to explore the same 78 archetypes.",
                "If you’ve ever wished tarot could be something you <span class=\"text-italic\">step into</span>, this is it.",
                "The charms are the part we didn’t expect to fall in love with as much as we did.",
                "They’re small. Simple. Easy to overlook at first. But once you start using them, they stay with you.",
                "Each of the <span class=\"bold\">78 Pearlescent Tarot Charms</span> carries the energy of a tarot archetype, but instead of living on a card, it lives in your hand. Some charms mark progress in the Quest. Some represent choices. And some just seeking you to detour. They sit beside you throughout the session, or end up back in the pouch with a little extra meaning attached to them.&nbsp;",
                "Over time, they start to hold memories.<br>“This one came up when I was stuck.”<br>“This one always seems to find me even if I returned it.”",
                "That’s where the magic happens.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">78 Charms (Acrylic, 28 × 20 mm)</span><br>These charms correspond to the full tarot archetypes and are designed for use in the Pearlescent Tarot Quest, ritual work, or collecting.&nbsp;",
                "You don’t need to prepare. You don’t need to know tarot. You don’t even need a plan.",
                "To begin the Quest:",
                "Let intuition guide your choices rather than overthinking",
                "That’s it.",
                "The Quest unfolds naturally as you play. Each charm you draw becomes a moment, sometimes playful, sometimes reflective, sometimes unexpected. There’s no “right” way to experience it. You simply move forward, one step at a time.",
                "If you can draw a charm and roll a die, you can play.",
                "Once you’re comfortable, the Quest opens up into something richer.",
                "As you play more intentionally, you’ll begin to notice:",
                "You can add layers by:",
                "Deeper Play isn’t about complexity, it’s about attention. The more you bring to the Quest, the more it reflects back. Whether you stop after a light, playful session or dive into a longer, story-driven journey, the Quest meets you exactly where you are.",
                "This might be for you if…",
                "Whether you come for the deck, the Quest, the charms, or simply the feeling behind them. <span class=\"bold\">Pearlescent Tarot</span> invites you to explore at your own pace, in your own way.",

                "Wonderstruck Studio started the simplest way possible: three buddies, a shared love for tarot, art, and making things with meaning. We’re a small indie studio, just the three of us working closely, slowly, and very intentionally. We don’t rush projects, and we don’t create things just to look good (though we do care a lot about that too). Every deck we make begins with a feeling, a story, or a question we can’t stop thinking about.",

                "Every pledge, share, kind message, and moment of encouragement has helped carry this project forward. We don’t take that lightly. Because of you, this deck has the chance to exist and that’s something we’re deeply thankful for.",
                "The journey is still ongoing, and if you feel like sharing the campaign, telling a friend, or simply keeping us in your thoughts, it truly helps more than you might realise. Even the smallest support makes a difference.",
                "We’ll continue to share updates and behind-the-scenes moments as we go, and we’re just really glad to have you here with us, walking this part of the path together."

And finally, above all, those monuments. Strange, abstract monuments. Each one different. Each one inducing changes in the minds of those who observe them. Some claimed they moved. Being near them evoked feelings of unease, sometimes even fear. Yet also wonder and an eerie longing.",
                "Such is the description told by those who claim to have visited that otherworldly (perhaps even extradimensional) realm. Lacking better words, it was simply called:<br>Nolands. Over the years many ventured there. Some even returned to tell what they saw.",
                "So what are the Nolands? A cancerous land feeding on our reality?<br>A sophisticated psionic weapon from a parallel universe? A neo-demiurgic experiment that got out of hand? The idea of a world that never came true? A shared nightmare dreamed under the influence of extraterrestrial drugs? A project made by unknown powers?",

                "Each artwork is presented in two separate formats:",
                "That way you can experience Nolands from different perspective and appreciate the masterful work of Przemysław Wideł and his one of a kind vision.",

                "He holds a PhD in Fine Arts in the discipline of visual arts and art conservation. He is an Assistant Professor in the 5th Drawing Studio at the Faculty of Painting of the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. He also works as an artistic project coordinator at the ACADEMICA Foundation of Students and Graduates of the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków.",
                "Wideł is a curator and exhibition designer, having worked on numerous exhibitions, including <span class=\"text-italic\">Stany Splątane</span>, <span class=\"text-italic\">Taniec duszy</span>, <span class=\"text-italic\">Turboprorok</span> and <span class=\"text-italic\">Confluence</span> at the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology; <span class=\"text-italic\">Młoda Akademia</span> at the Nowa Huta Cultural Centre; and the <span class=\"text-italic\">SYNESTEZJE.

His works have since been exhibited at Galeria Pryzmat, Bunkier Sztuki, the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology, Galeria OFF-FRAME, the Zamek Cultural Centre in Poznań, the Doctor’s House in Zakopane, Galeria Labirynt in Lublin, Klub Studio in Kraków, and The Sumida Hokusai Museum in Tokyo.",

She attended Beloit College in Wisconsin, where she obtained a degree in Fine Art. There she received several awards for her work, including Best Thesis for her sculpture installation. She also had the privilege of working as an advocate, teaching Art Therapy to survivors of sexual assault for three years. While doing so, she was recognized with the honor of Volunteer of the Year in the city of Beloit.  She worked as the Art Director at the Squash Blossom Gallery and later at the Broadmoor Galleries, where she enjoyed representing a wide range of artists and their work for several years. She enjoys working in a variety of different mediums including sculpture, oil, watercolor, and pastel. Recently she has gravitated towards multimedia projects.  This mixing of materials allows her pieces to develop in unexpected ways. For Sofi, there is no better feeling than allowing oneself space to play and experiment.

Sofi is proud to now be a full time studio artist since 2019 and enjoys living and creating art in the picturesque Downtown of Colorado Springs. While doing so, she has also been teaching multidisciplinary art classes to the youth of the springs, in hopes to foster creativity in the minds of the next generation. Currently she is focused on large scale public work projects such as her most recent 24 foot puppet commemorating a beloved local artist and legend Charles Rocky, featured in the town Marti Grau parade.",

                "How It Began",
                "It’s impossible to tell the story of my journey into creating giant puppets without acknowledging the tremendous losses they were born from. After the tragic death of my 19 year old brother Demitri , I felt compelled to live life fiercely, to lean into experiences that challenged and inspired me, but most importantly to orient myself towards the healing power of community. So when the prospect of making a puppet for a parade was presented, I dug my teeth into the endeavor hoping to bring art to the streets and celebrate life. Little did I know that the act of creating work that invigorated me would truly breathe life back into me, and thus the puppets were born! Last year we suffered another unthinkable loss, the death of our sweet Thomas, who led the 2024 parade with his unforgettable smile. This time, I felt the need to retreat, to lick my many wounds, to heal.",
                "This year the theme of the Manitou Springs parade is Love is All You Need.",
                "I have thought about the many flavors of love a lot in these past few years, sickly sweet love, laugh until you cry love, profound toe curling, teeth chattering love. Then there is the difficult love, the confounding love, the painful love, the void of heartbreak that is left when grief takes hold and love is all that is left behind. Love is comfort, love is pain, love is growth, love is renewal.",
                "Love is Wild!",
                "THE WOLVES",
                "For me, no animal encapsulates the immense, dynamic polarizing power of love quite like the wolf. This keystone species wields the ability to change worlds, shifting rivers, creating wetlands, and building habitats for multitudes of other life, wherever they roam. Mating for life, they show deep devotion and loyalty to their pack, helping to raise young and take care of their elders. They understand the tremendous strength in community. Yet even the bravest among us would have to concede that the site of a pack of wolves would send shivers down their spine. This apex predator both creates life and abundance, while simultaneously taking it. In our modern world we attempt to drive out adversity, persecuting predators in hopes of creating frictionless spaces, forgetting the essential balance nature requires. What does it mean to truly love? Can we ever truly love without risk, without tensions?",

                "The intent is to have these larger-than-life puppets enchant the crowds with their presence, creating a surreal and magical atmosphere, transporting us back to when we were children and everything seemed possible. This summer I hope to bring this show on the road, traveling all over Colorado. I have also been asked to partner with the Southern Ute tribe, as well as Ute Pass Elementary. My hope with these whimsical happenings is to help create community through shared memory. Now more than ever, the world needs art to unite us and remind us of our common humanity, to celebrate and allow ourselves safe spaces to embrace joy.",

                "This year I have been working on a pair of of wolves. These wolf puppets will stand roughly 12 feet high and be around 17 feet long. All of their joints will be fully articulating. I have also been working on rebuilding the 24 foot Charles Rockey puppet, in preparation to bring him back to his beloved hometown.",

                "Undertaking this project marks my biggest challenge yet as an artist.",
                "While the task ahead may seem daunting, I am filled with enthusiasm to bring this dream to fruition. Together, we can transform an artistic vision into a captivating reality, bringing art to the people and making it accessible, helping to foster an atmosphere of otherworldly whimsy and imagination. These enormous community projects are quite costly and require dedicated, knowledgeable blacksmiths, carpenters and transportation and storage fees, not to mention the enormous material expenses. The Charles Rockey puppet cost me $4,000 in materials alone and thousands more for storage. We were able to raise $3,000 with the help of generous donors, for whom I am most grateful, however I have yet to break even , let alone pay a penny towards my efforts. everything helps and is very much appreciated. I promise that any donations will be put to good use and help fill our streets with art!"

                "Around a year ago, a friend showed me a strange, if old, Discord bot. It was quite the thing. A bot similar in nature to what TupperBox, if you knowwhat that is, does, but specific to the transformation community. It was a then abandoned and rusty bot, but packed with a lot of features and old love. Stemming from a joke of \"I could do it better\", I whipped out in a week TransforMate. Originally a bot only ever used for two servers, my inability to advertise it led to it dying out and catching dust, with its only real merit being reviving the development of its predecessor.",
                "The story could very well have ended there, but, due to a series of events, that involved me bumping the server late in the night, and some very passionate people joining the server, that the bot got bigger than I ever expected it to. I had to verify it with Discord, and in less than three months it was in over 500 servers, and the server for it had grown into a cozy and vibrant community.",
                "It was inside this community, whilst going on a wild rant, complaining about the existing ways of sharing our passion for art, and how all of our once safe places had become plagued, either by people who shunned our existence and shouted bad-mouthed words at us, or the craze of AI drowning out the real art that has always stayed so close to this community. I said, as a comment, that I should make a better platform. One where the use of AI was moderated, where hate had zero tolerance, and where we can all search for, comment on, create, and rate quality content. Because enjoyment was always the point.",
                "So, with that little story, I want to talk to you about The Transformation Central, or TF Central for short. A hub for literature, digital and traditional art all about this marvelous community, that has brought me such joy over the years. With sorting, user ratings, and an intuitive search, and zero ads, I want to keep the site clean and intuitive. Somewhere where searching for stuff you like, and getting it recommended, is easy, and does not require you to get a masters on \"what should I sort by now\". We will also sort out AI and dangerous content, manually reviewing it carefully, and working with creators to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone, where we can enjoy real art, made by real people.",
                "I also want to approach this from the values that TransforMate has always represented for me. Values of freedom, ease of use, and free access. The only time when you'll be asked to pay for anything, is when you want to help creators you love, and get stuff they've made to cater to their audience. I will only take a 10% fixed fee over their earnings, which is the only way in which I will be earning money from this, which is necessary to upkeep both the physical infrastructure, as well as a moderation team, and my own ability to update the platform and fix errors with the utmost haste.",
                "Ideally, all of the code behind the platform will be shared as fully open source, for everyone to read, modify, or use, as long as it isn't in a commercial manner. The goal of this is both maintaining the same policy of openness as TransforMate, as well as allowing for people to help out, add features they want, or, if the project ever failed, be able to pick it back up from where I left.",
                "I have a lot of ideas to put into practice, but, this isn't a small goal. It's ambitious and risky. I need money to buy the hardware for the servers on which to host this platform, as well as to justify the enormous amounts of time and effort I would need to put to achieve this goal. I do hope I can see my dream through, and have your help in my way there. Guess I'll see you all at the end of the lengthy road. &lt;3"

De madre potosina y padre michoacano, inicia desde niño con su experimentación a través de diversas técnicas de dibujo y acuarela. Es al inicio de su etapa universitaria, cuando se propone iniciar una exploración más intensa del color y la composición dentro de la pintura, así como la creación de imágenes personales cuya inspiración la encuentra en la vida cotidiana de su entorno inmediato. En 2014 logra el primer proyecto artístico en el fondeo colectivo de Latinoamérica, creando una versión contemporánea de la antigua lotería tradicional mexicana. En 2015 funda el Taller de la Gráfica Independiente de México e inicia la realización de un fanzine en el mismo taller. En 2017 crea para la Universidad Cuauhtémoc un Árbol Cósmico en la serie de seis murales llamado \"La Herencia de la Noche\". En 2023 inicia con la dirección de la serie de retratos audiovisuales ElarteHabla, donde comienza a documentar conversaciones con los artistas vivos de nuestro tiempo. Por más de dos décadas ha trabajado por medio del performance, música, literatura, arte urbano, grabado, publicaciones editoriales, artesanía, video, pintura figurativa y abstracta.\r\n\r\nActualmente está volcado en las vanguardias que ofrecen la filosofía, la estética y la convergencia de las cosmogonías ancestrales latinoamericanas dentro del universo contemporáneo.",

No es reproducción decorativa.<br>Es una obra basada en la tradición, hecha para el presente.",

                "En 2014 Jahir Albor creó una serie de 52 obras originales al óleo, por medio de las cuales ilustró un juego de lotería basado en las temáticas más populares de la antigua lotería de México. Hoy publicamos la segunda parte de este proyecto.<br>Se generará una nueva serie de obras artísticas, ahora por medio de grabados originales basados en la misma colección. Puedes ver los detalles de la temática completa en <a href=\"http://www.imstagram.com/antigualoteria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.instagram.com/antigualoteria</a>",
                "Abordando la misma temática propuesta &nbsp;en 2014, el maestro Jahir Albor realizará la representación de cada elemento mediante grabado en linóleo. Para ello, cada imagen se refleja primero en espejo y de esta manera se trabaja en negativo. Con una navaja, el artista retira de la superficie del linóleo aquellas áreas que no desea imprimir. El resultado es una placa terminada, una matriz original que funciona como un sello a partir del cual se producirán las estampas.<br>Cada imagen surge de un proceso en el que no todo está decidido de antemano. El grabado exige tiempo, paciencia, presencia y riesgo. El error no se corrige: se incorpora. Aquí el artista no controla completamente el sentido; lo hospeda.<br>Las placas originales funcionan como un origen, como un gesto fundacional del que todo lo demás se desprende. Antes de cualquier reproducción, la imagen pasa por la mano y el cuerpo. La producción industrial no la sustituye: la prolonga.",
                "A partir de estas imágenes, el juego de lotería deja de ser un objeto lúdico para convertirse en un dispositivo performativo. En cada partida, las imágenes se activan en tiempo real mediante la voz, la espera y la atención compartida. Lo que ocurre no es solo un juego, sino un acto ceremonial. Este performance funciona de manera análoga a la vida misma: no todo está bajo control, el azar interviene, las decisiones se toman en el presente y el sentido se construye mientras ocurre. Cada jugada es única, irrepetible, y su significado depende tanto de la imagen como de su organización y posición dentro del juego, como de quien la nombra y quien la recibe.",
                "Al apoyar este proyecto haces posible que realicemos obras hechas con tiempo y oficio, a través de un lenguaje simbólico antiguo que dialoga con el presente. No financias solo una producción: participas en la continuidad de algo esencial.",
                "La serie está pensada con ediciones claras, procesos gráficos perdurables, coherencia conceptual y proyección a largo plazo.<br>Este proyecto no busca imponer un significado, sino invitar a recordar algo muy simple: Somos cuerpo, somos tierra y todos somos parte de un mismo espíritu.",

With more than two decades of experience across the global art, fashion, and media worlds, she has built a reputation for bridging creative disciplines while championing artists, designers, and cultural leaders on an international stage.\r\nHer career began in the heart of the contemporary art world, with senior roles at leading galleries including Yvon Lambert Gallery and Gladstone Gallery, where she worked closely with some of the most influential artists of her generation. Since 2010, Rachel has also contributed regularly to Vogue Italia, writing on the intersection of art, fashion, technology, and culture long before cross-disciplinary collaboration became a cultural norm.\r\nRachel is the founder of Vancelette Global Art Acquisitions, where she advises private collectors, institutions, and foundations on major acquisitions, exhibitions, and cultural strategy, as well as INTROXPERT, a creative-leader marketplace connecting vetted experts across art, fashion, media, and technology. Her work consistently centers on access, visibility, and empowerment, helping creative voices reach audiences that might otherwise never encounter them.\r\nLOOK UP was born from this same ethos. Conceived as a public art and media initiative rooted in optimism, reflection, and human connection, LOOK UP transforms one of the world’s most commercialized spaces, Times Square, into a platform for meaning, creativity, and shared experience. For Rachel, LOOK UP is both a call to action and a reminder to pause, to notice, and to re-engage with the world around us, together.\r\nThrough LOOK UP, Rachel invites audiences worldwide to experience art as a shared moment of presence, curiosity, and hope, proving that even in the busiest places, creativity can still unite, inspire, and gently shift perspective for everyone everywhere.",

After graduating, John moved to Cambria on California's beautiful central coast to work at Harmony Glass Works. In 2011, he moved to San Diego, CA to work as a resident artist at Cirello Gallery in North Park. In 2014, he opened his hot glass shop in San Diego, CA. He moved his hot shop to Northern California two years later. John continues to create his beautiful glass sculptures in Eureka, California.",

                "Hello! I'm John Gibbons, and for as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by the beauty of molten glass. That spark ignited when I was just a boy in Redding, California. My dad took me to antique bottle shows and pointed out bottles with rough, hand-finished bottoms. My 5-year-old imagination was hooked—I was compelled to learn how to work with glass and make it myself.",
                "That fascination became a lifelong pursuit. I started blowing glass at Shasta College in 2003 and earned my BFA in Glass from Chico State in 2009. 2013 was a huge year: I turned 30, built my first studio, got married, and welcomed our first child! Now, living in Eureka and blowing glass full-time, my family has grown to include two daughters and twin boys.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Why</span></span>",
                "For years, I've been creating in a secluded space, relying on only a few visitors a week. Now, I have an incredible opportunity to move my studio into the vibrant arts district of Old Town Eureka. This isn't just a move for me—it's a chance to build a vibrant community anchor that will bring inspiration, artistry, and hands-on education right into the heart of downtown.",

                "* Increase Visibility and Sales: Moving into a prime retail/tourist location means moving from a few customers a week to several customers a day, significantly supporting the growth of my business.",
                "* Inspire the Community: The new space will feature a showroom gallery showcasing glass art and a working studio that provides a public window into the incredible process of glassblowing.",
                "* Education: I will be able to offer glassblowing lessons and demonstrations, allowing locals and tourists alike to experience this beautiful craft firsthand.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">What</span></span>",
                "Moving a glassblowing studio is a massive undertaking. It involves large, heavy, and extremely fragile equipment—furnaces, glory holes, annealers, and pipes—all of which require careful handling and precise installation.",

I've had a long career writing, drawing, editing, designing and talking about comics, and I'm currently working as an Art Director and in-house writer for the brilliant weekly children's comic, <a href=\"https://thephoenixcomic.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"text-italic\">The Phoenix</span></a>.&nbsp;For <span class=\"text-italic\">The Firelight Isle</span>, I'm joined by my long-time collaborator, and life-partner...",
                "Kate has contributed a massive amount to the project. Since the beginning of Volume 2, we've been working extremely closely, and sharing the load on every stage of the art, from the thumbnails to the finished page. This book in many ways is hers, as she did the majority of the heavy lifting on art and layouts, and a part of the proceeds from the campaign will go straight to her.",
                "She just does this part time, though! Her own stories, including the phenomenal <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1388811224/faith-says-you-2-i-know-you-are-but-what-am-i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Faith Says You</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/03/fish-and-chocolate-unsettling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"text-italic\">Fish + Chocolate</span></a>, are profound, inspiring and disturbing by turns, and are full of the kind of creativity that makes me excited about comics.",
                "This time round, the books and slipcases will be printed by <a href=\"https://qinprinting.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QinPrinting</a>, who have an excellent reputation for quality and customer service. Full quotes have been obtained, and the initial goal and cost of products has been carefully considered to scale well.",
                "You'll be charged for postage and packaging once the books are ready to ship, through Kickstarter's pledge manager, which will calculate the costs of import duty for your country and add that to the cost of shipping so you don't get any surprise fees when your reward arrives!",
                "The cost of shipping to destinations outside the UK may be high, but I'll be working with a shipping company to attempt to reduce these fees as much as possible before you're charged.",
                "I've now run or been involved in 5 crowdfunding campaigns, so know the process intimately. The backers themselves can attest how well the previous campaigns have gone, and it's been wonderful to see books with readers across the world...",
                "This project has been written, drawn, produced and presented without any use of generative AI.",
                "When we create, we don't just make products to be consumed, we engage with the world, we learn, and we grow. When we read a story, we indirectly experience the journey that the author has been through, like a ghost in the art.",
                "Making this project has changed me profoundly, and all its flaws and qualities come entirely from that process."

                "Remember hope? Yeah… same. It’s time to face reality—with a little dark humor.",
                "Enter I FEEL DOOMED, a new comics anthology that turns generational dread into creative release. Tackling everything from student loans and housing stress to climate anxiety and political exhaustion, the book captures what it feels like to live in a constant state of low-grade apocalypse—through the voices of artists who’ve traded doomscrolling for drawing.",
                "The project is curated by Joseph Karg (Archer, Marvel Snap!, Dear Bernadette) and published through his imprint Soup Drunk Princess, bringing together students and seasoned professionals in a shared creative space. The result is something that feels equal parts anthology, emotional outlet, and late-night group chat about the end of the world—where art becomes a way to keep going when everything feels like it’s falling apart.",
                "Across more than thirty stories, I Feel Doomed dives straight into the collective unease of a generation shaped by chaos. Themes range from creeping authoritarianism and climate fear to isolation, burnout, and the exhausting act of pretending everything’s fine. Each piece reshapes that anxiety into something strange, funny, unsettling, and deeply relatable—a snapshot of a generation coping with collapse through nervous laughter and too much caffeine.",
                "The anthology features an impressive lineup of creators, including Miki Montlló (Wonder Woman/Harley Quinn), Thierry Martin (Le Roman de Renart), Claudio Acciari (The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado), Jonathan Edwards (Mufasa, Warner Bros.), Rustam Hasanov (Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon), Chris Bivins (Marvel Snap!, Stargirl), Danielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots), Dustin Harbin (Koyama Press, Dinos That Drive), June Brigman (Power Pack), Adam Ford (Rick and Morty, Star Trek: Lower Decks), Jake Reeves (Titmouse, Royal Crackers), and Claire Seckler, an emerging CalArts storyteller.",
                "“We all process our feelings in profoundly different ways. Some of us laugh in the face of despair, others draw, write, build, or hide. But no one escapes the need to make sense of a world that feels like it’s slipping apart. This project is a collection of short stories and images that don’t deny that feeling; they hold it up to the light. I hope that, as readers move through these vignettes of doom, they’ll recognize parts of themselves in the hopeful, absurd, or darkly funny moments that surface between the cracks. Doom itself is universal, but how we all respond to it is deeply personal—",
                "A little less than a century ago, 70 million people died across Europe, Russia, and Asia. Faced with unimaginable grief, humanity turned to the only tool that could hold that weight: Art. We painted, wrote novels and poems, drew comics, made movies, and even animated cartoons about silly rabbits fighting the same wars we were. Art is how we process the unprocessable. It helps us turn chaos into story, pain into meaning. I Feel Doomed is part of that same impulse—to face what’s breaking in the world and, through creativity, remind ourselves that beauty and resilience still exist.”",
                "If Black Mirror started a group chat with Love, Death + Robots—and invited a therapist who’d completely given up—it might look a lot like I Feel Doomed. Perfect for fans of The Silver Coin, Flight, or any anthology that feels like peeking into the shared subconscious of 2025, this is a book that admits what we’re all thinking: we’re just trying to survive a slow-motion apocalypse.",
                "<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/i_feel_doomed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I FEEL DOOMED INSTAGRAM</a> - features a ton of behind the scenes content including process videos, interviews, developmental images, sneak previes and more!",
                "What makes <span class=\"text-italic\">I Feel Doomed</span> different from most anthologies is that it refuses to treat comics as the only valid language. While the book is filled with powerful sequential stories, it also makes space for work that lives somewhere adjacent to comics—illustration galleries, visual essays, and pages that sit between image and thought.",
                "Artists like <span class=\"bold\">Akira Beard</span> (featured above) <span class=\"bold\">Martin Campos</span>, <span class=\"bold\">Rustam Hasanov </span>(featured below), <span class=\"bold\">Bill Cleveland</span>, <span class=\"bold\">Benji Williams</span>, and <span class=\"bold\">Dustin Harbin</span> contribute galleries of images paired with written reflections on doom itself. These pieces don’t tell stories in a traditional panel-to-panel sense. Instead, they invite you to linger. To read an image, then read a thought, then sit in the space between the two. The result feels less like consuming a narrative and more like overhearing someone articulate a fear you didn’t yet have words for.",
                "By including this kind of work alongside more conventional comics, <span class=\"text-italic\">I Feel Doomed</span> becomes something closer to a conversation than a collection. It acknowledges that doom isn’t always experienced as a story with a beginning, middle, and end—sometimes it’s a mood, a realization, or a question that arrives fully formed and refuses to leave. This book makes room for all of that.",
                "That same philosophy extends beyond the page. Animators from Lucky Draw Productions have contributed <span class=\"bold\">ten pages of concept and production art</span> from <span class=\"text-italic\">Doomscrolling</span>, the animated short film created to open the <span class=\"text-italic\">I Feel Doomed</span> Kickstarter video. These pages pull back the curtain on the animation process itself—storyboards, visual development, and moments of experimentation—offering another way into the project’s central themes.",
                "There are <span class=\"bold\">only three original art pages</span> available at the <span class=\"bold\">$500 tier</span>.",
                "Before pledging, please <span class=\"bold\">email me directly</span> so you can let me know <span class=\"bold\">which page you’d like</span>. I’ll confirm availability and <span class=\"bold\">guarantee your choice</span> before you complete your pledge. josephkarg@gmail.com",
                "Once confirmed, you’re free to submit your pledge knowing that the page you want is secured.",
                "Here's a better look at the Double Splash page. Since this is 1 of 1, there is no need to contact me if you want it.&nbsp;",
                "The cover of <span class=\"text-italic\">I Feel Doomed</span> is a <span class=\"bold\">one-of-a-kind mixed media painting</span>, created through a rare collaborative process.",
                "The piece began as a traditional painting by <span class=\"bold\">Joseph Karg</span>, then moved into the digital realm where it was <span class=\"bold\">embellished and refined by Rustam Hasanov</span>. From there, the image returned to the physical world and was <span class=\"bold\">fully repainted by Karg</span> on <span class=\"bold\">18 × 24 Hot Press Arches paper</span> using <span class=\"bold\">acrylic and pastels</span>.",
                "This final artwork is not a print, reproduction, or study—it is the <span class=\"bold\">finished, physical cover painting</span> that defines the visual identity of the book. The layered process mirrors the spirit of <span class=\"text-italic\">I Feel Doomed</span> itself: traditional craft, contemporary tools, and multiple artistic voices working in conversation.",
                "Signed, unique, and irreplaceable.",
                "Shipping will be collected <span class=\"bold\">after the campaign</span>, when surveys go out in <span class=\"bold\">June</span>. We’ll be using <span class=\"bold\">BackerKit</span> to handle addresses, sizing, add-ons, and shipping costs.",
                "This means <span class=\"bold\">you will not be charged shipping during the Kickstarter campaign</span>. Instead, shipping will be calculated later based on your location and the items you selected, helping us keep those costs as fair and accurate as possible.",
                "Please expect shipping to be a <span class=\"bold\">separate charge from your February pledge</span>. Using BackerKit allows us to avoid guessing on shipping costs now and helps ensure your rewards arrive safely and efficiently.",
                "US Estimates are $13-20 depending on your zone and bundle",
                "International can be wildly different. I recommend looking up your rate for a 6lbs package for your country from the US. Most countries at the time I'm writing this are around $80 while Australia is $130.&nbsp;"

                "NINJA HIGH SCHOOL is a manga series created by BEN DUNN in 1987. It is a story about an ordinary high school student, JEREMY FEEPLE, in a small town whose life is turned upside down when a kunoichi (female ninja) named ITCHY KOO and an alien Princess name ASRIAL suddenly entered his life!",
                "Help us colorize the original Black and White NINJA HIGH SCHOOL series by creator BEN DUNN.",
                "If you're not familiar with us, my name is Ben Dunn, and I created Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1985. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 40 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like&nbsp;Ninja High School and Gold Digger. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Kickstarter program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. You may have &nbsp;seen some of our other successful and fulfilled campaigns.",
                "Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is my long running series NINJA HIGH SCHOOL which recently celebrated its 200th issue. NINJA HIGH SCHOOL is a manga comedy set in the fictional small town of Quagmire where it is occupied by ninjas, aliens, monsters, mad scientists, furries, cyborgs, superheroes and all manner of weirdness as part of everyday life.&nbsp;",
                "One of our most frequently received fan requests over the years is, \"When can I see the original black-and-white series of&nbsp;NINJA HIGH SCHOOL&nbsp;in color?\" Getting a book colored is not an easy proposition due to the cost and time involved, and both of those commodities are scarce in the independent publishing world. But with Kickstarter, it is now possible to achieve that goal.",
                "Thanks to you I was able to color issue no.1 and no.2! Now I hope to continue coloring the rest of the series starting with issue 3.",
                "&nbsp;Here is a small sample of what was done. Below are original and colored pages from&nbsp;NINJA HIGH SCHOOL #3.&nbsp;",
                "The money collected in this campaign will go to paying the colorists to perform the task of coloring. And for each $1000 we collect beyond the initial $1000, we will color the next issue. For instance, if we hit our goal, we will color Ninja High School #1. &nbsp;If we collect a total of $2000 with this campaign, we will then proceed to the next issue which is Ninja High School #2, and so forth and so on. &nbsp;Supporters will receive the PDFs of each completed issue that is colored, and those in the upper pledge tiers will also get the issues that have already been colorized.",

                "Hello! My name is Key Lager. I aspire to become a successful self-publishing mangaka.",
                "The purpose of this fundraiser is to collect funds to create prints of MOTUS's first volume. You may ask, \"What is MOTUS?\"",
                "MOTUS is a dream of mine. Ever since I was 16, I have fantasized about characters, human emotions, and the \"what if\" scenario: What if these emotions were characters we had to face daily? What would humanity's accumulated emotional state look like in the real world? I finished school, and years went by. Until now, I have worked to create this exciting psychological battle shonen manga based on this thrilling \"what if\" scenario. There are thrilling and intense action scenes, of course, but also touching human stories. They are not just characters that fulfill a trope. I want to depict humanity in all its beauty and horror.<br>MOTUS and humans live in the same world, but in different dimensions. Gwyn Heartstone, an adolescent high school student, is the only connector between the two realms. By entering a state of transcendence called \"Soul Form,\" he can step into an undiscovered space and fight the mighty Motus that disturb the peace of humanity. The mystery of what these creatures are lingers in the human-inhabited world.&nbsp;",
                "Prepare to experience the real horror of what MOTUS are capable of. You will feel thrilled and get goosebumps while watching Gwyn struggle to protect humanity from their own demons. This unorthodox narrative will make you second-guess your assumptions about this genre.",
                "I can fulfill the technical aspects of this manga series in many ways, but I lack the financial support to make my dream a reality.",
                "I will be transparent about where I intend to use the funds:",
                "That would total an estimated 1,500€, including 40 regular books and 10 limited-edition deluxe books.",
                "With your support, you will earn a spot in the final print of the manga, marking your presence in real time.",
                "With your support, MOTUS can take its first real step into the world of Manga!"

                "When I first started writing Angel Protected, I was 16 years old. I really loved Sailor Moon and other Japanese manga like Berserk and Gunsmith Cats. But as much as I love Sailor Moon, there wasn’t much that I could relate too culturally. School wasn’t the same in America as it is in Japan, teen life in general is so much different too. And there weren’t any black girls as leads in any of the Japanese Manga a that time, or even today really. So, I set out to write my own Magical Girl story, one that would reflect the life of Americas. It would be centered around the lives of me and my bestest friends. But as I got older I started asking myself more in-depth questions about the world a Magical Girl lives in, then I had an epiphany! I would first write a Magical Girl Origin Story! So basically I asked myself, “what if Naoko Takeuchi told the story of Usagi before she and the sailor scouts where reborn on Earth?” And “what if the main character was a young black princess living in a dark fantasy world?” And thus became the story of Angel Protected.",
                "In Angel Protected you will meet our Magical Girl, Princess Tiara Aira Earthian. The youngest daughter of the Guardian of the Earth, Queen Elaine. Tiara lives in the world of Agartha that is located at the center of the Earth. in our story Princess Tiara is unexpectedly chosen to be the next Guardian of the world and now has to take the place of her Mother. But the path to Guardianship isn’t like when her mother first started, now there is a dark force threatening to cast the world into darkness and end the cycle of Earths Guardians. Tiara must travel across Agartha to the seven temples to unlock her Guardian abilities and power the Rainbow Barrier, a powerful shield that protects Earth. With it, it will banish the dark demons from the Earth.",
                "Angel Protected is a unique hero’s journey, magical girl origin story, and a dark fantasy rolled up in one, and presented to you with a magical bow. With little representation of black female lead characters in Comic Books and Manga, Angel Protected brings a fresh perspective on black culture and entertainment coming into the anime/ manga industry.&nbsp;",

From that foundation grew our \"Seven Cards\" philosophy and the progenitor Big City Drink and Draw. We exist to forge real connections and put the heart and craft back into sequential art through high-energy gatherings filled with challenges and collaboration. ✊ - Today, we connect artists through dynamic events and partnerships with iconic institutions like the revolutionary Art Students League, the historic Society of Illustrators, and the influential Art Directors Club. Our mission, under the direction of founder Charles \"Sincero\" Chenet, is to honor this creative legacy while building the future. ❤️‍ -Don’t just wait. Create. — The Dare2Draw Team",

                "Start of April in 2025, I’ve decided to take a chance. And make a fanmade Gemchild for Ruby and Sapphire.. a Gembaby as you will. And so.. Rubellite was created!&nbsp;(Or born haha)&nbsp;<br><br>She’s the daughter of Ruby and sapphire (and Garnet) I wanted them to have a biological child, especially the being my favorite characters. yes, I know Gems can’t have children. But what if they can?? So I took that risk, and around in June to July I posted the start of her comic series “Roads To Nothing” Rubellite’s story. I posted it on TikTok first, not expecting much support and more backlash. Well.. not long after it blew up. 105k views on TikTok, and almost 3-5K likes. Each pages close to 100’s of likes and now 5K followers. All the support to a Gemchild of mine&nbsp;<br>I hardly see people make Gemchildren, only in stories you see, but not in comic form, or hardly many with lore. SU brought me joy and I know brought joy to others around the globe. But this comic has inspired, brought joy, and made people take chances on creating new things that are not “possible” or just don’t happen.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you all so much for making this happen! I’m honored you love this Gembaby just like I do! And hope you bring her home!&nbsp;<br><br>Just feed her cookie cats or she’ll eat yours&nbsp;"

                "MagHub Quad Max features three <span class=\"bold\">18.5-inch displays</span>, prioritizing <span class=\"bold\">usable workspace</span> over compactness alone. Instead of shrinking content to fit smaller panels, Quad Max allows information to stay at <span class=\"bold\">natural, comfortable sizes</span>. This reduces the need for constant zooming, scrolling, or window resizing and creating a workflow that feels <span class=\"bold\">more intuitive and less constrained</span>.",
                "MagHub Quad Max gives traders and analysts the screen space needed to <span class=\"bold\">monitor markets in real time</span>. With <span class=\"bold\">three large 16:9 displays</span>, charts, order books, news feeds, and dashboards remain visible at the same time, allowing decisions to be made faster without constant window switching or lost context.",
                "MagHub Quad Max supports modern development workflows by allowing developers to dedicate separate screens to their <span class=\"bold\">code editor, terminal, documentation, and live previews</span>. With tools kept organized and always in view, context switching is reduced, focus is easier to maintain, and long working sessions become more efficient.",
                "MagHub Quad Max enables a true multi-display editing setup, allowing timelines, assets, tools, and previews to be placed across separate screens. This supports faster edits, greater precision, and a more natural creative workflow, wherever you work.",
                "MagHub Quad Max supports face-to-face presentations by allowing the top display to be flipped toward your client. Slides, data, and visuals can be shared clearly, while you maintain full control from your laptop screen, creating a more natural and professional presentation experience.",
                "In group settings, MagHub Quad Max becomes a shared visual workspace. A triangle-style display layout keeps key information visible from multiple angles, allowing everyone at the table to follow along naturally. Side screens can be used for notes, references, and supporting materials, helping discussions move more smoothly and decisions come together faster.",
                "MagHub Quad Max uses <span class=\"bold\">18.5-inch Full HD (1080P) displays</span> with a <span class=\"bold\">16:9 aspect ratio</span>, delivering a familiar and efficient workspace for everyday professional applications.

This allows content to remain clear and accurate even when the displays are viewed from the side or shared across a table and ideal for collaboration, presentations, and multi-angle setups.",
                "To support long working sessions, the displays incorporate <span class=\"bold\">Low Blue Light technology</span>, helping reduce eye strain without introducing harsh color shifts. Combined with a brightness level of <span class=\"bold\">300 nits</span>, the screens stay clear and comfortable in typical office and indoor environments, balancing visibility with visual comfort.",
                "MagHub Quad Max is equipped with <span class=\"bold\">two USB-C ports</span>, designed for maximum flexibility. <span class=\"bold\">Either port can be used to connect to your laptop and another to the 45W USB-C PD power adapter, </span>and there is no fixed “power-only” or “laptop-only” port. This interchangeable design allows you to set up MagHub Quad Max in the way that best fits your workspace, without worrying about which side to plug in first. Once connected, the system automatically manages power and data to ensure stable multi-display performance.",
                "MagHub Quad Max includes <span class=\"bold\">physical brightness buttons</span> that allow you to adjust screen brightness quickly and directly on the device. With simple button presses, you can adapt the displays to different lighting conditions, whether you are working in a bright office or a dimmer environment.",
                "MagHub Quad Max features a <span class=\"bold\">precision-crafted aluminum stand</span> designed to provide stable support for multiple large displays. The rigid metal structure minimizes flex and wobble, keeping the screens firmly positioned during typing, interaction, and long working sessions.",
                "MagHub Quad Max uses a <span class=\"bold\">reinforced aluminum hinge system</span> designed to securely support large displays while allowing smooth, controlled movement. The hinges provide the right balance of stability and flexibility, keeping screens firmly in place once positioned. Built for repeated folding and unfolding, the hinge design ensures reliable performance over time, so MagHub Quad Max stays stable whether you’re set up at a desk or on the move",
                "Despite its expanded screen space, MagHub Quad Max is built with portability in mind. Its <span class=\"bold\">foldable structure</span> allows the displays to collapse neatly when not in use, making it easy to pack, carry, and store between workspaces.",
                "When folded, <span class=\"bold\">MagHub Quad Max fits neatly alongside your laptop in a single portable bag</span>. The slim, collapsible design allows both devices to be carried together, making multi-screen productivity practical even when you’re moving between locations. Whether you’re commuting, traveling, or working from different spaces, Quad Max is designed to go where your laptop goes without requiring a separate case or bulky transport solution.",
                "MagHub Quad Max is designed to work with <span class=\"bold\">modern laptops across the most common platforms</span>.

The physical design accommodates most laptops ranging from <span class=\"bold\">12” to 18”</span>, making Quad Max suitable for a wide variety of workflows and hardware configurations.",
                "Getting started with MagHub Quad Max is quick and straightforward.",
                "Once connected, your screens will light up automatically. Your laptop is now transformed into a <span class=\"bold\">four-screen workspace</span>, ready for focused, efficient work anywhere.&nbsp;",
                "MagHub Quad Max uses a professional multi-display driver to enable stable, extended screen output across different operating systems. The setup process is straightforward and only needs to be completed once.&nbsp;",
                "MagHub Quad Max can also be powered by a <span class=\"bold\">power bank that provides 45W output or higher</span>. This allows you to use the full multi screen setup even when a wall outlet is not available. With a compatible high power power bank, MagHub Quad Max becomes a truly mobile workstation, making it easy to work during travel, at shared spaces, or in temporary setups where fixed power is limited.",
                "We are delighted to offer <span class=\"bold\">worldwide Free shipping</span> for all MagHub Quad Max backers. To ensure a smooth and hassle-free delivery experience, we have carefully implemented the following shipping and duty policies:",
                "MagHub Quad Max was developed with a focus on expanding the laptop workspace while maintaining portability and structural stability. The design centers around three large 18.5-inch displays integrated into a foldable system that opens smoothly and locks securely in place. Special attention was given to screen alignment, hinge strength, and overall balance to ensure a stable multi-screen setup during use.",
                "Throughout development, we refined the folding mechanism to allow the system to transition easily between an expanded workspace and a compact, travel-ready form. The hinge structure was engineered to support repeated folding while maintaining precise positioning. On the display side, we selected IPS panels with Full HD resolution to ensure consistent color, clarity, and viewing angles across all screens. This consistency is especially important in a multi-display environment where visual alignment directly affects comfort and usability.",
                "The system is designed to operate through a single USB-C connection, reducing cable clutter and simplifying setup. Internal layout and cable routing were optimized to support clean operation and long-term reliability. As development progressed, prototypes were tested and refined to validate durability, folding performance, and multi-screen functionality. Feedback from hands-on demonstrations and early showcases helped guide final adjustments before moving into the verification and production phases. MagHub Quad Max represents a balance of industrial design, mechanical precision, and practical usability — built to deliver a full workspace experience in a portable form.",

Having your extension displays with just FHD will be a drastic worse experience working side by side as its intended. Isn't there a chance to add better screens? I guess everybody would be willing to wait a little longer but could get a much better viewing experience, less tiring and better screens for production work (video and pictures).",

                "<span class=\"bold\">Hi! We are Titaner.</span>",
                "Over the past five years, we've proudly delivered our passion projects to over <span class=\"bold\">43,545+</span> <span class=\"bold\">backers</span> around the world. Now, we're excited to unveil our <span class=\"bold\">66th</span> Kickstarter campaign:",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Reviving the lost art of analog calculation.</span>",
                "Before silicon chips ruled the world, before glowing screens took over our thinking, engineers relied on <span class=\"bold\">slide rules</span> to build skyscrapers—and even to send humans to the Moon.",
                "Computation in that era was about finding answers through direct interaction with the physical world. It carried a particular clarity—an unmistakable kind of romance belonging to the mechanical age.",
                "At Titaner, we have long been fascinated by this kind of intelligence at the fingertips.",
                "Years ago, we created the world’s first titanium ring ruler, completely redefining what a “ruler” could be. That original point in titanium became the starting point of a long evolution.",
                "After three generations of iteration, our pursuit of precision has diverged into two clearly different paths:",
                "Today, we are proud to introduce the latest piece in this line of calculation — <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span>.",
                "It is a bridge between the physical world and the mathematical world. It takes the accumulated wisdom of the slide rule and houses it in an aerospace-grade titanium body, bringing analog calculation back to your fingertips.",
                "We are not simply selling a ruler; we are delivering a portable geometric solution.",
                "We are not just making tools—we are listening to your voices.",
                "On our previous calculating ruler, we chose a fine ratcheting feel. It was smooth, but many of you told us: <span class=\"text-italic\">“I want clearer feedback.”</span>",
                "So with <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span>, we responded by bringing back the widely praised soul of the first-generation Tiroler—the <span class=\"bold\">high-strength magnetic lock</span>.",
                "Every time Tisolver completes a full rotation (10 cm), the magnetic system releases a clear, firm tactile pulse, accompanied by a crisp <span class=\"text-italic\">“click.”</span><br>That click is a private signal between you and the numbers. You don’t need to stare at the scale constantly—your fingers and your ears tell you how far it has traveled. This is intuition in its most practical, craftsman-like form.",
                "Simple and intuitive, with no mental math required:<br><span class=\"bold\">(Number of clicks × 10) + current reading = total length</span>",
                "Here’s a simple example:",
                "👂 Hear <span class=\"bold\">2 clicks / tactile pulses</span> (20 cm)<br>👀 Align the window with <span class=\"bold\">3</span> (3 cm)<br>✅ <span class=\"bold\">Result = 23 cm</span>",
                "With this built-in navigation system, you are finally freed from the limitations of a straight ruler.",
                "Effortlessly measure all kinds of irregular curves in daily life—this is the unique appeal of the ring ruler.",
                "Standard CNC knurling is cool—but on certain extreme surfaces, it still isn’t enough.",
                "So for <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span>, we upgraded the contact surface with a custom soft rubber O-ring, delivering a higher level of physical friction.",
                "But for Titaner, that still wasn’t enough.",
                "This is an invisible design—something you won’t see, but you will feel in use. On the inner side of Tisolver’s metal rim, we precisely machined a ring of special reverse anti-slip teeth. These metal teeth firmly <span class=\"text-italic\">bite into</span> the inside of the soft rubber O-ring.",
                "The result?",
                "Whether on a greasy workshop table or freshly splashed <span class=\"bold\">wet glass</span>, Tisolver stays planted and rolls with control—like a gecko gripping a surface.",
                "Blurry readings? No. We gave <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span> a pair of tactical glasses.",
                "In pursuit of the best possible reading experience, bare metal markings were not enough for us. We designed a precise <span class=\"bold\">quarter-arc transparent reading window</span>. It’s not just a cover—it functions more like an optical component.",
                "At first glance, you’ll notice a vivid red reference line embedded at the center of the window. It works much like a sniper scope, locking onto the scale and making the numbers easier to read at a glance.",
                "We use <span class=\"bold\">PMMA (recyclable acrylic)</span>, precision-machined on top-tier CNC equipment.<br>It offers <span class=\"bold\">over 92% light transmission</span>—higher than standard glass—while delivering <span class=\"bold\">10–15× the impact resistance</span> of glass.",
                "PMMA is <span class=\"bold\">BPA-free</span>, non-toxic, and when burned, it primarily produces <span class=\"bold\">carbon dioxide and water</span>. It also has excellent resistance to aging and UV exposure, remaining <span class=\"bold\">clear and stable for over ten years</span>.",
                "This is the most suitable material we could find for the job.",
                "The Titaner-level detail lies in how this window is executed. It perfectly follows the curvature of the ring ruler and intentionally includes a slight raised clearance. This space prevents the transparent window from rubbing against the finely etched markings inside, while also providing a degree of physical protection for those markings. At the same time, it introduces a subtle parallax effect that helps achieve clearer, more accurate readings.",
                "Tisolver is not just for recording data—it’s for solving problems.<br>By etching two of the most commonly used engineering logics onto the titanium <span class=\"bold\">Side A</span> and <span class=\"bold\">Side B</span>, Tisolver transforms from a simple ruler into an analog computer.",
                "Want to know what the data in your hand looks like in another language?<br>In a world where metric and imperial systems coexist, conversion is always a headache<br>(1 inch = 2.54 cm? Forget it—no one wants to do mental math while working).<br><span class=\"bold\">Tisolver makes this intuitive. </span>On Side A, we laser-etched both a 10 cm metric scale and a 4-inch imperial scale on the same ring. It becomes a physical bridge between two measurement languages.",
                "First, use the built-in magnetic tactile feedback to return Tisolver to zero, and align the transparent HUD window with the zero mark. This is the starting point for all calculations.",
                "For values under 10 cm (for example, 7 cm), simply rotate the transparent window and align the red reference line with the metric number 7.<br>The imperial scale that the pointer crosses at that moment is your answer.",
                "If you measured the length with Tisolver first and then convert units, you’ll notice that the red line naturally aligns with both metric and imperial values at the same time—simple and intuitive.",
                "For larger numbers—say, the “ultimate answer to the universe,” <span class=\"bold\">42</span>—this is where classic slide-rule logic comes in: the decimal shift.",
                "No need to open an app. Just glance down—the answer is already there.<br>Measurement, calculation, and communication have never flowed this smoothly.",
                "A traditional ruler can only tell you how long a <span class=\"text-italic\">line</span> is.<br><span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span> can tell you how large a <span class=\"text-italic\">surface</span> is.",
                "For designers, leather crafters, and DIY enthusiasts, this is more than a ruler—it’s a secret weapon in your pocket. As you measure a side length, the corresponding squared value (area) appears directly.",
                "Cutting a square piece of vegetable-tanned leather? Estimating the coverage area of a wooden board?",
                "Measure just one side, and you can immediately anticipate the area. This isn’t simple arithmetic—it’s the magic of unfolding a one-dimensional world into two dimensions.",
                "On <span class=\"bold\">Side B</span>, we built an entirely new logic:",
                "The outer ring retains the standard <span class=\"bold\">10 cm metric scale</span>.<br>The inner ring is etched with a <span class=\"bold\">dedicated square-calculation scale</span>.",
                "The operation is as natural as breathing.",
                "Just like Side A, use the magnetic tactile feedback to return Tisolver to zero, and align the transparent HUD window with the zero mark.",
                "Simply rotate the transparent window and align the red reference line with the side length on the outer scale (for example, 5 cm).<br>Before you even have time to think, the red line is already pointing to the calculated result on the inner scale (25).",
                "If you measured the length with Tisolver and then perform the calculation, you’ll notice that the red line aligns with both the metric value and the squared value at the same time. The interesting part is that when you flip Tisolver over, the red line also aligns with the corresponding imperial value. In other words, with a single measurement, you get the imperial equivalent and the squared result at once.",
                "This is the appeal of analog calculation—no buttons, no waiting, just a direct physical connection between <span class=\"bold\">input</span> and <span class=\"bold\">output</span>.",
                "With a single measurement, you can obtain both the imperial equivalent and the squared value. What’s the secret behind this?",
                "In this design, we carefully arranged the scale logic. <span class=\"bold\">Side A and Side B roll in opposite directions</span>, giving <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span> true all-around adaptability.",
                "It’s not just that one roll reveals all the related values. More importantly, no matter whether you naturally pull from left to right or push from right to left—whether you’re left-handed or right-handed—the dual-side scale logic of Tisolver adapts naturally to your intuition.",
                "You don’t need to decide in advance whether you’re “calculating area” or “checking imperial units.” Just focus on the measurement itself.",
                "Once the roll is complete, the distance is structurally locked. At that moment:<br>Want metric-to-imperial conversion? Look at <span class=\"bold\">Side A</span>.<br>Want area estimation? Look at <span class=\"bold\">Side B</span>.<br>Or maybe you simply have a number in mind and want to know its square or its imperial equivalent.",
                "All the data in Tisolver exists simultaneously. This non-linear workflow lets you move through complex tasks with ease.",
                "Tisolver shouldn’t be buried in the dark corner of a toolbox.<br>It’s a badge—representing your appreciation for precision manufacturing and logical thinking.",
                "We designed <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span> so you can carry it with you 24 hours a day.<br>It’s both a tool—and a seriously functional everyday carry item.",
                "Every Tisolver comes with a lanyard. You can wear it on your chest, where it becomes an engineer’s talisman, always ready for the next measurement challenge. Or you can attach it to your tactical backpack, zipper pull, or keychain. Its matte titanium-gray finish subtly elevates the look of your entire EDC setup.",
                "Looking for even more protection? You can add our custom <span class=\"bold\">vegetable-tanned leather</span> sheath. Over time, the leather will darken and develop a natural patina, recording the marks of use and time—forming a quiet contrast between soft leather and titanium that never wears out.",
                "When you’re stuck thinking through a solution, or waiting for a render to finish exporting, your hands need something to release the tension. <span class=\"bold\">Tisolver</span> becomes that switch for your thinking.",
                "Thanks to its addictive magnetic mechanism, Tisolver doubles as a high-quality <span class=\"bold\">fidget toy</span>.",
                "This crisp, rhythmic mechanical feedback helps ease anxiety and guide the mind into a <span class=\"bold\">flow state</span>. It doesn’t distract you—it helps you focus.",
                "For us, <span class=\"bold\">“designed for lifelong use”</span> is not just a promise engraved in metal—it’s a philosophy of growing and evolving together with you. And this Kickstarter campaign is where that philosophy truly comes to life.",
                "Our designers are not working alone in a closed workshop. They stand here alongside you—our most trusted partners and co-creators—listening carefully to every idea and suggestion. Because we firmly believe that a truly great product is never created in isolation; it is shaped by the real experience and insight of the people who rely on it every day.",
                "The journey of <span class=\"bold\">Titaner Tisolver</span> does not begin on an assembly line. It begins with a solid block of <span class=\"bold\">GR5 titanium</span>.",
                "Like <span class=\"bold\">Michelangelo</span> facing a block of marble, we use top-tier CNC machines to carve each component over many hours of precise machining. Every edge is finished with smooth, rounded CNC chamfers.",
                "To be honest, this is time-consuming, labor-intensive work—something few are willing to do. But we believe true quality doesn’t need to be explained in a manual. The moment you hold it in your hand, you’ll understand.",
                "That warm, smooth feel, as if it naturally belongs in your palm; the flawless detailing that never catches your skin, no matter the angle—<br>all of it tells you one thing: our obsession is worth it.",
                "Sweat, rain, seawater—for inferior metals, these are nightmares.",
                "They can turn so-called “tough” tools into rusted, fragile objects overnight. But our hero—<span class=\"bold\">GR5 titanium</span>—is completely immune.",
                "It is non-toxic, skin-friendly, and corrosion-resistant—a “super material” safe enough to be implanted in the human body. No matter how harsh the environment, it remains clean and stable, protecting you through every adventure.",
                "We chose an extremely <span class=\"bold\">fine</span> <span class=\"bold\">blasted matte finish</span>. It removes the cold, harsh feel of raw metal and gives the body a smooth, pebble-like warmth and a refined grip.",
                "This matte surface creates ideal diffuse reflection, reducing glare under strong light and making the engraved scales easier to read.",
                "In addition to the <span class=\"bold\">metric version</span>, Tisolver is also available in an <span class=\"bold\">imperial option</span>.",
                "We previously designed our imperial ring ruler with a 5-inch circumference. However, we recognized that the imperial system is fundamentally <span class=\"bold\">base-12</span>, and 5 inches proved cumbersome for real-world calculations.",
                "That's why we re-engineered the TiSolver with a <span class=\"bold\">6-inch imperial circumference</span>.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">2 Rolls = 1 Foot.</span>",
                "This base-12 optimized adjustment transforms traditionally awkward imperial math into an experience that is <span class=\"bold\">unprecedentedly smooth and intuitive</span>.",
                "The unboxing moment should be part of the experience as well.<br>Your <span class=\"bold\">Titaner Tisolver</span> arrives in a beautifully designed gift box. Whether you’re rewarding yourself after a hard year, or giving it to a friend or family member who shares your love for life, it’s a gift that’s sure to earn a genuine <span class=\"text-italic\">“Wow.”</span>",
                "One more thing worth mentioning: this elegant box is made from <span class=\"bold\">100% recycled paper</span>.<br>Yes—while pursuing performance and precision, we’re also making a small effort for the planet.",
                "We are not newcomers to Kickstarter. Over the past five years, we have successfully delivered our work to more than <span class=\"bold\">43,535 backers</span>. We’ve faced every challenge you can imagine (yes, including those <span class=\"text-italic\">epic</span> supply-chain issues) and have maintained a <span class=\"bold\">100% fulfillment rate</span> throughout.",
                "We understand that in the world of crowdfunding, <span class=\"text-italic\">keeping your word</span> matters far more than polished language.<br>But don’t just take it from us—listen to what longtime members of the <span class=\"bold\">Titaner</span> community have to say.",
                "You can make your Titaner TiSolver even more versatile!",
                "When supporting this project on Kickstarter, you won't be billed for shipping immediately. Instead, shipping fee will be charged via a fulfillment survey after the campaign ends.",
                "Please Note: The listed price is for the product only and does not include shipping or Sales tax / VAT. After the campaign ends, shipping costs will be calculated based on your region. Customs/import taxes vary by country and are the supporter's responsibility to check and pay.",
                "We’re a small team of engineers and friends who share a deep love for design and precision craftsmanship.<br><span class=\"bold\">The Titaner Tisolver</span> isn’t just our newest creation — it’s our redefinition of what a “good tool” can be.",
                "For us, a great tool isn’t just about performance — it’s about feel, detail, and the invisible connection between maker and user.And if you haven’t heard of our <span class=\"bold\">“Dreams Come True”</span> program — you should.If you’ve got a bold idea for a new product, we’d love to help you make it real — and reward you generously for it.",
                "Hey — you made it all the way here! 🎉<br>You’re awesome.",
                "We want to sincerely thank every friend who’s supported Titaner — whether you’ve been with us since our first project or you’re just discovering us today.",
                "Your trust, feedback, and enthusiasm have made this journey meaningful beyond words.<br>Building a brand <span class=\"text-italic\">with</span> people who share our passion is the coolest thing we can imagine.",
                "It’s our greatest honor to keep creating things we truly love — and to share them proudly with the world.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Thank you again.</span><br>May your gear inspire your next great story. 👋",

                "It delivers a close, comfortable shave without irritation, gimmicks, or waste — and it’s intuitive enough for anyone to use, even if you’ve only ever shaved with cartridges or electric shavers.",
                "T8 is the safety razor we set out to create, shaped by our <span class=\"bold\">design experience</span>, <span class=\"bold\">engineering expertise</span>, <span class=\"bold\">aesthetic sensibilities</span>, and understanding of what makes a <span class=\"bold\">great shaving tool</span>. It is the result of extensive prototyping, testing, and refinement.&nbsp;",
                "After more than four months of focused research and hands-on evaluation, we arrived at a version the entire team genuinely loves and uses.",

After analyzing key <span class=\"bold\">geometric parameters</span> across a wide range of mainstream double-edge safety razors, we found that T8’s benchmarks naturally span the same effective range as many of the most popular and well-regarded designs.&nbsp;",

                "For those who prefer a more conservative shaving experience, we’re exploring the possibility of expanding the adjustment range, for example from <span class=\"bold\">−0.10 mm to +0.30 mm</span>. If this can’t be achieved while maintaining the same form factor and overall dimensions, we’ll offer multiple configuration options—such as <span class=\"bold\">−0.17 mm to +0.17 mm</span>, <span class=\"bold\">0 mm to +0.25 mm</span>, or the current <span class=\"bold\">+0.17 mm to +0.32 mm</span> range.",

Our goal is simple: to deliver shaving tools that meet the standards of <span class=\"bold\">laboratory-level </span>research and testing. We take the pursuit of the ultimate shaving experience seriously, and we design every razor with that commitment in mind. This is shaving reduced to what actually matters:",

                "At the heart of T8 is a <span class=\"bold\">fully adjustable mechanism</span> that allows you to fine-tune the shave to your exact needs. Settings 1 through 8 change in a linear, continuous manner.",

                "Despite its precision, T8 couldn’t be simpler.",
                "Modern cartridge systems rely on multiple blades and lubrication strips, electronic razors uses pivoting heads and plastic — yet still manage to cause irritation and drive costs higher year after year.",
                "T8 uses <span class=\"bold\">standard double-edge razor blades</span> for a reason:",
                "You don’t need subscriptions, marketing gimmicks, or six blades on your face to get a great shave.",
                "There is no standard answer for what shaving angle (the angle between the blade and your skin) works the best. But we all know that the shaving angles for different face, facial hair types and stubble lengths are different. So it's very important that the shaving angles can be adapted to the different faces, or a certain condition of the same face. The 1~8 sizes of T8 makes it super easy to adjust the angle by adjusting the rotating knob at the bottom.",
                "You don't need the protractor to find your perfect angle. You just twist your T8 starting from size 1, and feel how it works at different size, and remember the best setting for you. You can even have size 1 or 2 for \"1 day shaving interval\" , and size 4 or 5 \"3 day shaving interval\" . If you are with thicker and coarser facial hair, you can start from 3 and choose the best that works for you. Your T8, your say.",
                "T8 gives you the perfect freedom to choose the best settings for you. And the scale lines make it super easy to find the perfect angle every time.",
                "Have you ever wondered, like we have?",
                "This isn’t a necessity, but many discerning men choose to use two or even three razors to achieve their ideal shave. With T8, <span class=\"bold\">a single razor can do the work of many</span>. Its <span class=\"bold\">continuous adjustability</span> invites <span class=\"bold\">exploration and fine-tuning</span>, turning shaving into a process of discovery rather than repetition.",
                "We believe there’s a quiet kind of happiness in this—finding satisfaction in the things that must be done. Within everyday routines, T8 creates space to slow down, care for yourself, and enjoy moments of calm. It’s an opportunity to step out of the noise, enter a state of flow, and find simple fulfillment in a familiar ritual.",
                "There are so many reasons you’ll love the T8. And these details are why you’ll leave this T8 on your washbasin&nbsp;and start to look forward to the daily shaving routine.",
                "You can choose to use the open comb or close comb on the either sides of the top cap. Closed comb feature a safety bar providing a milder shaving making it well-suited for beginners or those with sensitive skin or daily shaving. Open comb razors have a design that allows hair to be guided to the blade, offering a closer shave. They are preferred by experienced users especially those with longer or coarser hair as they also allow shaved hair and lather to escape more easily.",
                "After the project end,&nbsp;backers will be able to select their preferred comb configuration in the post-campaign survey&nbsp;(where shipping address, razor configurations and add-ons will be confirmed by backers)&nbsp;. Options will include <span class=\"bold\">dual closed comb</span>, <span class=\"bold\">dual open comb</span>, or a <span class=\"bold\">mixed open-and-closed comb</span>, as shown in the current prototype.",
                "T8 features a clog-free design, whether you choose the close comb or open comb, there is guiding grooves for the hair and shaving cream to leave the blade, so it won't clog no matter if you are with thin and soft hair or thick and coarser hair.",
                "By saying full titanium, we meant even the <span class=\"bold\">spring inside</span> is made from titanium. So everything on T8 can withstand the test of heat, cold, drop, and disinfectant of all types. It's a bullet-proof razor, and the only thing that needs to be replaced is the double-edged razor that can be found almost everywhere in the world at about $0.1 per piece. You can choose your preferred blade based on your habit.",
                "Titanium itself is non-magnetic, so the magnetic function is provided by N52 ring magnets, which are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron and are fully protected with an anti-corrosion coating. As a result, the only components that are <span class=\"bold\">not titanium</span> are the <span class=\"bold\">carbon steel blade</span> and the <span class=\"bold\">N52 magnets</span>.",
                "Magnetic blade holder on the top of the case is also a detail that will make you \"aha~\" for that. The blades are securely held at the top the case, and the small slope is super satisfying to put in and take out the double-edged blade.",
                "Besides that, the <span class=\"bold\">bottom of the razor</span> is also inbedded with a magnet to guide the bottom to sit firmly at the bottom of the razor case. It's a clever \"<span class=\"bold\">First locate, then place</span>\" design that make the pleasant experience last from the beginning to the end of every shave.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">aluminum case</span> is a magnetic closed one, and at the center of it is a N52 strong magnet that can be used as a great razor stand for T8.&nbsp;",
                "Metallic titanium luster with hand-polish for smooth and glossy feel or beadblast matte gray for calm and low-key style. Forget about the brass with chrome plating or cheap zinc alloy. We are 100% titanium from inside out.",
                "Plus, we take advantage of the titanium metal property&nbsp;and offer a <span class=\"bold\">unique purple titanium insert</span> to get rid of the stereotype that all safety razors are just similar. Not for T8. More colors? Let us know in the comment section!&nbsp;",
                "Hollow design can <span class=\"bold\">lower the overall weight</span>, provide an <span class=\"bold\">anti-slip grip</span>, and to bring the <span class=\"bold\">overall aesthetics</span> to the next level. If it’s a whole block of anodized purple part, it’s plain, but the purple inside the hollow handle is like the lace peeking out from the neckline. Of course, if you don’t like this&nbsp;revolutionary mix-color scheme and prefer full gray, full silver or maybe full black, that would be no problem at all, of course.",
                "Not only looks cool and mechanical vibe, but also provide different fit&nbsp;from the right to the left, offering a natural and flowing shaving experience.",
                "The setting scales are processed with nanosecond laser engraving. The marking produces <span class=\"bold\">permanent</span>, <span class=\"bold\">high-contrast</span> markings that <span class=\"bold\">resist wear and fading</span>, without affecting the integrity of the titanium material.",
                "The CNC-machined, properly chamfered adjustment knob is visually refined, easy to operate, non-slip, and designed to minimize dirt and grime buildup.",
                "The aluminum case works as a <span class=\"bold\">storage case</span> for <span class=\"bold\">shaving on the go</span> or for business trip. The grooved top and matte black finish looks decent and blends in perfectly for any style.",
                "More than a storage case, it also works as a <span class=\"bold\">razor stand</span> that’s with a compact profile.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">drain holes</span> on the bottom&nbsp;and the ventilation holes on the front part make sure the inside is always <span class=\"bold\">dry and ventilated</span>&nbsp;to prevent bacterial growth.",
                "Ventilation holes on the sides and bottom work together to promote airflow, keeping the interior dry and well-ventilated while helping prevent odors and bacterial buildup.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">silicone strips</span> inside the case also prevent the razor handle from friction or metallic clanging sound during everyday carry. Taking out or putting back the razor is a enjoyment every time.",
                "Even the cheapest cartridge razors cost significantly more over time than T8.",
                "Once you make the switch:",

                "CNC machining allows us to control geometry, tolerances, and surface quality with a level of precision that casting or molding can’t match. For an adjustable safety razor like T8, this precision is critical — it ensures consistent blade alignment, smooth adjustment, and reliable performance at every setting. The result is a tool that feels precise in use, operates smoothly, and maintains its performance over years of daily shaving.",

                "We finally got the satisfying razor that's like a piece of art and a precise work of engineering.",
                "Only after achieving a fully functional, production-ready prototype did we move forward. Every detail exists for a reason. Nothing is decorative. Nothing is wasted.",
                "Safety razors have been around for over a century, yet many misconceptions still prevent people from trying them. We want to address a few of the most common ones — honestly and clearly.",
                "In reality, modern cartridge razors often cause more irritation due to multiple blades repeatedly scraping the skin. A well-designed safety razor uses a single blade and controlled geometry, reducing tugging and razor burn. With adjustable settings like those on T8, users can start gently and shave with confidence.",
                "While cartridge razors may seem cheaper upfront, their long-term cost is far higher. Replacement cartridges are expensive and recurring. A titanium safety razor is a one-time investment, and standard double-edge blades cost only pennies. Over time, it’s significantly more economical.",
                "Below is the results based on median market prices across different types of razors. For electric shavers, the calculation accounts for battery lifespan and a reasonable replacement frequency for blade heads. For all other products, blade replacement is calculated using typical replacement intervals under normal usage conditions.",
                "A proper safety razor shave doesn’t need to be slow or complicated. Once familiar, most users find it just as fast as cartridge shaving — often faster, since fewer passes are needed. T8 is designed to make the transition simple, even for busy routines. You can search on Youtube and find any cyber father/ brother pleasing to the eye, and it's way more easier than you thought.",
                "Not true. With an adjustable razor, beginners can start on mild settings and gradually find what works best. There’s no advanced technique required — just a better tool designed to adapt to you.",
                "The concept is classic, but the engineering is modern. T8 combines proven shaving fundamentals with contemporary materials, precision machining, and adjustability — offering a better solution, not a nostalgic one. Classic is the new trend, and T8 can stand the test of the most discerning users and the test of time.",
                "A safety razor offers a <span class=\"bold\">simpler, more controlled</span>&nbsp;way to shave. With a single blade and precise angle control, it <span class=\"bold\">reduces unnecessary passes</span>&nbsp;over the skin, helping <span class=\"bold\">minimize irritation and razor burn</span>. It’s also more <span class=\"bold\">cost-effective</span>&nbsp;over time, using affordable, widely available blades instead of expensive cartridges.&nbsp;",
                "Combined with durable materials and thoughtful design, T8 turns shaving into a comfortable, efficient routine—one that’s better for your skin, your wallet, and the long run.",
                "T8 isn’t about nostalgia. And it’s not about trends. It’s about building the best possible shaving tool — one that adapts to every face, eliminates waste, and lasts a lifetime.",

Together with Axel Siehr, I developed the UNCLE X DIY and built the prototype myself. We spent days and nights thinking, discarding ideas, starting over, testing, and refining — back and forth, up and down — until the product stood exactly as it does today.\r\n\r\nI design products that don’t pull movement out of everyday life, but bring it back to where it belongs: into living spaces. I’m not interested in fitness equipment that takes up room or dominates an interior. I care about movement that is quiet, natural, and becomes a lasting part of daily life.\r\n\r\nTogether with Axel, we develop and build every prototype ourselves — from the first sketch through construction and material testing to a product we truly trust. We work with our hands, with wood, with real materials — not just on screens.\r\n\r\nFor this mindset, Patrick Siehr as a designer and Heimholz by Siehr as a brand were awarded the Green Product Award – Best of Interior & Lifestyle, selected by an international jury from over 1,500 submissions across 56 countries.\r\n\r\nWood is not a styling choice for us. It is a promise: durable, honest, and timeless.\r\n\r\nWith UNCLE X DIY, we continue this philosophy.\r\nWe have reimagined wall bars — space-saving, modular, and designed for real living spaces.\r\n\r\nUNCLE X is not a fitness device.\r\nIt is a tool for everyday movement.",

Built for families, surfers, and everyday drivers, RadRack lets you use your vehicle the way it was meant to be used.",
                "RadRack came from a problem we were living with as a family. We drive a Bronco with a soft top not by choice, but because hardtops weren’t available when we bought it. We still wanted to get our surfboards to the beach without putting the top down every time, without installing roof crossbars, and without loading boards inside the vehicle where our kids ride. Some people suggested strapping boards directly to the soft top, but that never felt right. The risk of damaging the top was real, and it wasn’t how we wanted to travel with our family. And it wasn’t just our situation. Whether you drive something older and well-loved or something brand new, most of us rely on our vehicles every day and we want to use them without worrying about unnecessary damage. No one wants to climb onto a roof, cram boards inside, or compromise just to get to the beach.",
                "At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you drive. We’re all heading toward the same thing: <span class=\"bold\">waves</span>.",
                "That’s when we realized the spare tire was wasted space. Instead of forcing a roof solution that didn’t fit real life, we designed around the tire itself.",
                "RadRack was born as a stable, accessible way to carry surfboards that just works.",
                "RadRack mounts securely over your vehicle’s rear spare tire, creating a dedicated surfboard-carrying solution that’s easy to use and out of the way. It keeps boards accessible at the beach, off the roof, and out of the cabin without drilling into your vehicle or changing how you drive day to day. Designed with real-world surf trips in mind, RadRack works for quick sessions, family outings, and everyday driving.",

For years, I’ve felt that the climbing market was becoming stagnant, dominated by corporate giants that lost their connection to the rock. I decided it was time for a change.\r\n\r\nBasalto is my response. It’s a project born from the desire to inject fresh air into the scene. I’m bringing the legendary Brianza work ethic—precision, quality, and innovation—into a brand that belongs to the community. I’m not just a designer; I’m the guy next to you at the crag, working on the same project, dreaming of gear that finally lives up to our passion.",

I'm Sarah, an illustrator and pin-maker based in Reading, UK and the woman behind Glitter Punk.\r\n\r\nThe body of my work focuses on animals (with other elements of witchy-ness, feminism and the odd pun thrown in for good measure!) I often like to play with the concept of opposites – day and night, black and white, and animals adorned with flowers.\r\n\r\nPeople buy my accessories for so many reasons - whether to add to a pin collection, as a reminder of a pet, or as a gift for friends or family. I hear my customers say again and again how thrilled they are with their pieces; using them either as a fun way to express themselves or to show their affection to a loved one.",

                "KarinaJ Denim started with a frustration I couldn’t shake.",
                "Women’s bodies change constantly. Our weight can fluctuate by up to five pounds in a single day due to hormones, stress, travel, water retention, or simply life. Traditional jeans, however, are built around buttons and zippers—structures that are inherently rigid. No matter how much stretch is added to the fabric, jeans are still designed to fit a single moment in time, not an entire day.",
                "I knew there had to be something better.",
                "KarinaJ exists between those two extremes. We are building premium, slip-on jeans designed to adapt to real women’s bodies and real lives — jeans that look polished enough for work or dinner, feel good all day, and don’t punish you when your body changes.",
                "From the beginning, I was intentional about how these jeans would be made. I source our denim from the same mill used by many premium brands, and we manufacture right here in Los Angeles, ensuring ethical wages, better oversight, and a more sustainable production process. Comfort shouldn’t come at the cost of craftsmanship — or values.",
                "So you might be curious when this journey started.&nbsp;",
                "In January 2023, I flew to New York to attend Kingpins, the world’s largest sustainable denim trade show. I didn’t go with a finished plan — just a lot of questions. That trip pulled me into the mechanics of denim and helped me see that this not a fashion problem but a product problem",
                "Over the next three years, I obsessively worked on getting it right. My house filled with fabric swatches as mills mailed denim samples back and forth. I hired a former Levi’s designer to land on the right fabric and core design, iterated through six rounds of prototypes, and hosted fittings with the input of a technical designer from Athleta to master fit and function. I even went through two manufacturers before finding one that could truly execute the vision.",
                "This past year was about pressure-testing every detail. I ran three fittings across all sizes, and at one point had to move a fitting — and nearly move it again — because the wash was slightly off. The jeans technically worked, but they were not right. I chose to wait. In denim, small details matter.",
                "One of the most nerve-wracking parts of this journey was not making the product but sharing it. For a long time, I was afraid to put these jeans into the world, unsure how they would be received. When I finally did, the response surprised me. Women immediately understood the problem and embraced these jeans with open arms.&nbsp;",
                "At pre-launch parties, I had women say \"I wish I could take these home today\" or \"These are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn.\"",
                "Hearing this over and over made one thing very clear: I didn't want this to stay a side project or quiet launch",
                "That’s why I’m launching KarinaJ Denim on Kickstarter.",
                "This campaign helps fund our first production run and brings you into the process from the beginning. We’re launching with four styles — a straight leg and a bootcut leg, each in light and dark washes — designed to look polished, feel good all day, and adapt when your body changes.",
                "So if you’ve ever wished your jeans worked <span class=\"text-italic\">with</span> you instead of against you, I built these jeans for you &lt;3"

I have had <span class=\"bold\">five successful </span>Kickstarter projects with <span class=\"bold\">two being enamel pin campaigns</span>. Cathulu is one of my OG creatures from my D&amp;D monster books and a top seller for my stickers. I have been wanting to design regional variants of my grumpy little dude since there are so many cool octopus and squid in our world!&nbsp;",

                "<span class=\"bold\">These high quality hard enamel, screen-printed pins are set to scale to be to size with each other. That way the chonkers are big and the kittens are small!&nbsp;</span>",
                "By supporting these pins on Kickstarter, you will be receiving a<span class=\"bold\"> 25% discount from my final retail price and additional savings with greater quantity packs.&nbsp;</span>",
                "You will also be directly supporting me, an independent artist, with my next round of merchandise for conventions. The funds raised will help me print 100 of each design when they are unlocked. This will give me extra stock for going in future con seasons and help my small business get new product lines up!"

                "Found in the Underground exists to honor that feeling — not as nostalgia, but as something worth carrying forward into the everyday. A reminder that community doesn’t have to be loud to be powerful, and belonging doesn’t have to be earned.",

                "• <span class=\"bold\">The Master’s Secret:</span> I look for the beauty in <span class=\"bold\">interior seams</span>. In my signature \"exposed seam\" technique, these hidden structures become the primary avant-garde ornament.",

                "Beauty is more than skin deep<span class=\"bold\">. I use 100% new cotton, linen, and wool for the lining</span> so that while the exterior looks rugged and 'distressed', the part touching your skin feels like a soft embrace.",
                "Each <span class=\"bold\">VORONA</span> scarf is a unique, handcrafted piece, but they all follow a similar size profile. Triangle scarf.

Material Requirements: To maintain the high quality of the final piece, I work exclusively with natural fabrics (wool, cashmere, heavy cotton, or linen).\n3. The Creation: Once approved, you ship the item to my studio. I will deconstruct it and combine your \"legacy fabric\" with my signature reclaimed denim or leather to create a one-of-a-kind VORONA scarf.\nNote: Shipping the original item to the studio is covered by the backer.

                "It all started on a street I used to live on called Rothschild. At the time i was a visual display designer VDD and CEO at LINDBERGH/PWT WAGNER USA. Essentially my job description was creating a wardrobe-on-a-rack; Creating color coded collections where all garment types were interchangeable for creating outfits. I excelled, but it wasn't what I wanted to do as far as fashion goes. I was a designer at heart, but I was never given the opportunity at the company to create collections or make my own pieces. I was always too busy to actually manage doing the things I loved. I was complacent, and satisfied with my life and salary. But the idea of creating an RTW runway collection was always in the back of my mind, and I constantly told myself that one day, I would get to doing it. But like many things that day never came, until everything came crashing down, until my world fell apart. 2 years ago I was let go from what I thought was my forever job, the love of my life, or so I thought, had left me, and I entered into a quiet depression, and became a recluse in my own home. In my seclusion, I started to unveil my life, and the time I had left to actually do the things that made me happy, more importantly, the things I loved. I had nothing to lose, because well, I had already lost everything, and thats the way I saw it. This leave of absence from my past day-to-day life gave me perspective, and allowed me to do things I never imagined I would do. If I had nothing to lose, then well I had everything to gain, I thought. And for the first time in my life, I took a risk. I found the courage to put my fears to rest, I found the will to go out there and try to make something happen. Sitting at cafe downstairs my building, I started to draw the logo, and the accompanying designs. It hit me! House of Rothschild. Ready-to-wear functional lingerie. I dove into the remainder of my savings, bought sowing equipment and mannequins, and brought on two veteran creative partners to help me build a collection. Larry Tobis and Katya Moore. We didn't know what we were making or what we were doing in the beginning, all we knew is that we were becoming, becoming real designers. Fate is funny, we had all just been reeling from recent simultaneous misfortunes in our lives, and somehow found each other, as friends first, and then as partners. And just like that, it clicked, overnight. We had similar styles, thoughts, ideas, and understanding of what we wanted to make, even though it still wasn't clear to any of us. We were draping and patterning, sewing, and then the next thing we knew, we went from making singular one-pieces to full blown dresses, gowns, skirts, pants, underwear, anything that inspired or came to mind. As the collection developed it took on a life of its own. Pieces started to mirror each other, harmony between the assemblage of items started to sync in unimaginable and interchangeable ways. The collection was essentially steering us, without hashing-out branding details over large pieces of white board. It took on a life of its own, it had a heartbeat, no longer on life support. It became edgy and mysterious. Dark and ominous, yet vibrant and delicate. It didn't borrow from anything we knew, because we refused to borrow ideas and methods. It didn't seek to to replicate market successes either, because I wanted to make what I wanted. It was purely a passion project, something I loved that turned into something I could have never imagined. It went from HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD to HOUSE of ROTH. It became dystopian, a-symmetrical, black &amp; white - harnesses, buckles, stainless inserts, zippers utilitarian functionality. Again nothing I could have imagined. It borrows from nothing but our founding passions and ideas. Bold usage of neoprenes, leathers, nets and sheers. It tests the limits of whats acceptable. It pushes the frontier forward without apology. It's what we saw, and continue to see and draw and dream-up, and now all thats left is making it into a reality. The reality of sharing it with the world, and becoming the next major house of fashion, based right here in the United States, and made in America. The simple dream of walking outside one day and seeing someone wear something you made, and loving it, thats what makes it all worth it. And now we are here! Taking the next step. And so if I ever want this to become the brand that changes the world, I'm going to need people who believe in what were doing. We have already created more than 100 samples, in just one year. Some finished, some unfinished because of time constraints, and because we all have other living-wage jobs that occupy us just so we can pay the bills. But HOUSE of ROTH is what we do on our spare time, which is every night, in our chats, time alone, at every free opportunity given, on our days off... The collection is nearly ready. I need to create more samples and the accompanying tech packs. I just need to facilitate an additional - paid sewing hand to speed up the process, funding for a wow-factor website, and additional machinery for close-stitch operations. Creating finishes for our samples, would drastically reduce our sample making costs and at the same time help us build altogether better pieces. Old machinery has usage constraints. By creating fully developed tech-packs for manufacturing and sourcing, production time will be halved, because we do it in-house. Second, our branding strategy speaks for itself. A dystopian retro-90s approach to RTW runway. In an age where the elemental of what is the brand doesn't have to be highly definable, what it should be is the result of what the response is to what we are doing. We brake all the rules and take no prisoners doing it. The brand will shake up the industry and challenge its peers in every garment group, and thats the pillar we intend to coast on when it comes to our logos, futurist designs, and reckless attitude of just doing what defines us.&nbsp;"

                "We founded ESPARTINAS from opposite sides of the globe—Spain and Mexico. Though geographically distant, our countries share a long and intertwined history. Likewise, we share a 12-year friendship built on trust, creative alignment, and a shared respect and curiosity for craftsmanship.",
                "Originally, our idea had been very different. While living in Paris, we dreamed of selling Talavera ceramics — we had always loved Talavera and wanted to bring a piece of home into our everyday life abroad. The real turning point came when Cristina invited me to La Coruña, in the north of Spain. There, I became obsessed with finding a pair of genuine Spanish alpargatas. One afternoon at the beach, sharing a simple cañita, we had an epiphany: what if we created footwear inspired by Talavera and merged both of our cultures into a single product?",
                "We had always wanted to work in fashion since we were young. As a child, I (Jose) used to sneak into my grandmother’s closet and clack around the house in her shoes, convinced they were the most beautiful and magical objects in the world. She would place her older pairs on the lower shelves so I could reach them, protecting her good shoes on the top shelves so I wouldn’t take them jumping into puddles and mud.&nbsp;",
                "I (Cristina), meanwhile, had grown up wearing espadrilles for every occasion and listening to my father speak passionately about exporting Spanish footwear for its beauty and craftsmanship. He began his own export business years ago before sadly passing away in 2020. Six years later, we found the perfect passion project, a way for Jose to honor his grandmother’s encouragement, and for me to honor my father’s legacy.",
                "We first met at the Interlochen Center for the Arts: Cristina as a dancer, and I as a pianist and composer. Our lives took many turns, but creativity always remained at the center. With ESPARTINAS, we finally found a way to channel that shared creative spirit into something tangible — bringing the beauty of our roots into a single, meaningful project.",
                "Our vision is to bring together the essence of both cultures into a single, cohesive product—one that honours the folklore and traditions of Spain and Mexico, and unites them through careful and curated design. Espartinas is the result of this convergence: a product that does not merely reference heritage, but carefully integrates it, creating something beautiful and timeless.",
                "<br><span class=\"bold\">OUR JOURNEY</span>",
                "After months of research, we found a factory in Spain that could bring to life exactly what we had designed and envisioned. After giving the idea some thought and creating our business plan, we put together out first draft in February 2025 and finalized the designs in April 2025.",
                "We sent the first mockups to production in June 2025 and received our first prototypes at the beginning of September. After multiple tests and adjustments, we finally received the finished product in October 2025.",
                "This project has been designed and crafted with so much love and passion. We believe it offers something unique in the market—a dialogue between cultures that breaks boundaries through style. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do! 🦋",

From Aaron Deese, Sasquatch: Variable attempts to examine the disparate parts of the “Sasquatch Encounter Phenomenon”, asking simply what it is about Bigfoot that has prevented human beings from “finding” it, and what the future may have in store for the research community as technology and conversations continue to develop. Featuring interviews with members of Project Zoobook, The Olympic Project, Wild and Weird West Virginia, Micah Hanks and many others, Sasquatch: Variable will examine both the phenomenon itself, and the varied perspectives of those involved in the ongoing search for Bigfoot."

We've been backing your wonderful projects since 2020 and really have a difficult time choosing our favorites.  Each documentary offers so much and are highly rewatchable.  If anyone is looking for something that is the perfect combination of history, lore, mystery, and perhaps a chill up the spine, then look no further.    And all of this is presented in a visually stunning way.    We love all the topics and Erica is especially excited to see Dogman Legacy.  I'm really eager to see Season 2 of On the Trail of UFOs. ",

                "<span class=\"bold\">My name is Abigail Rose. I’m 25 years old, and I’m preparing for a six-month solo motorcycle expedition through Central and South America to create a film.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The journey begins in the Mayan lands of Yucatán, Mexico, and winds through Central America, across the Andes, and deep into the Amazon, ending in Brazil. Along the way, I’ll travel from archaeological sites to significant ruins, following ancient roads and living traditions, to explore how myth, land, and story have always connected us.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">I’m a studying archaeologist, writer, and longtime solo traveler. But to be honest, this project isn’t driven by academic ambition alone. The logistics are intimidating: earning my motorcycle license, buying a bike, crossing borders, navigating jungles and mountains with limited experience. I have mentors. I have encouragement. Still, I had to ask myself what could possibly fuel such boldness.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">At first, I told myself this burning desire to take to the roads of Central and South America was in the name of archaeology. That’s true, partially. I study archaeology. I love it. But archaeology alone doesn’t quiet the fear, or override the warnings, or explain the certainty that keeps pushing me forward. What I am really searching for is something that’s lit me up since I was a child, something that sent me racing across the Middle East in a battered rental car toward a city of djinn, that landed me as an untrained deckhand on a Spanish catamaran through the Corinth Canal, that pulled me to the pyramids of coastal Peru and the jungles of Ecuador.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">I was looking for magic.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Not magic as illusion or parlor tricks, but magic as a relationship. Oxford archaeologist Chris Gosden defines it this way: </span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">“Magic emphasizes human connections with the universe, so that people are open to the workings of the universe and the universe is responsive to us.”</span></span><span class=\"bold\"> Alongside science and religion, magic was one of humanity’s earliest ways of understanding the world. It sees spirit in the land, kinship between humans and animals, and meaning in transformation. Where science separates us from the world, magic immerses us within it, asking moral questions about how we relate to the universe itself.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">This worldview was central to ancient civilizations and indigenous cultures across Mesoamerica and South America.</span><br><br>&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">The Maya were master timekeepers, aligned with cosmic cycles.</span><br><span class=\"bold\">The Aztecs built advanced cities grounded in ritual and warfare.</span><br><span class=\"bold\">The Chimú conquered the Pacific on some of the earliest surfboards, guided by their moon god, </span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Si</span></span><span class=\"bold\">.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Across cultures and continents, these societies understood something we’ve largely forgotten: humans, land, myth, and spirit are not separate.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">This film follows my solo motorcycle journey through these ancient landscapes. Traveling by road, exploring archaeology, mythology, and the living cultures that still carry these stories today. I’ll be standing face-to-face with places I once knew only from textbooks, where history isn’t locked behind museum glass but embedded in the earth itself.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Traveling alone by motorcycle allows for full immersion and slow, intentional travel filled with conversations with locals, scholars, and fellow travelers; oral histories passed down outside of academia; and a raw, embodied relationship with the land. Through first-person storytelling and immersive cinematography, this project explores how ancient knowledge continues to shape our understanding of humanity, and how we might rebuild a relationship with the collective spirit of the Earth.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">This is not a traditional travel vlog, and it’s not a detached academic documentary. It’s a personal journey- reflective, authenic, and deeply human- where the road and landscape is my classroom. My goal is to make archaeology and anthropology accessible, alive, and even humorous, inviting curiosity rather than gatekeeping knowledge.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Along the way, I’ll document:</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Ancient sites and their mythological significance</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Oral histories and living traditions</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The emotional and physical realities of solo travel</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The ways land, identity, and story intertwine</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Echoes of prehistoric myth that still shape modern life</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">At its heart, this project is about remembering connection in a world of separation, between people and place, past and present, science and magic.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">I don’t claim to be all knowing. I'm no hero, no expert. I’m just a student, a messenger, following old stories across old roads. If this work sparks wonder, curiosity, or a sense of belonging to something older and larger than ourselves, then it’s done its job.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Because every culture across time has told us the same thing:</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We are not separate from the Earth.</span><br><span class=\"bold\">And we have never been alone.</span>",

                "One More Please, is a British social realism film that follows Kyle, a high functioning alcoholic who muddled his way through the day, trying to get into contact with his sister. Their relationship is strained as they haven’t spoken in years. He has a constant battle with his addiction and things become significantly more difficult when he's triggered by memories of him and his sister as children. The siblings face a heart to heart as they reunite in an awkward way- shes an escort. Their argument reveals past traumas and the ins and outs of their behaviour towards each other. This information is a big shock to Kyle. He finally asks for help from his sister to&nbsp;&nbsp;overcome his addiction.",
                "THIS IS A STUDENT FILM- your support goes directly towards transport, locations, food and basic production costs.",
                "As the director and screenwriter, I whole heartedly believe that everyone is addicted to something in life, whether it be something physical like a person, drugs or alcohol or something psychological like your self image, gaming, social media, relationships or life style habits. It's important to me to be able to explore the desires and need for addiction and the tolls it takes on those around you.&nbsp;",
                "Everyone involved in the project has experienced some sort of addiction or hyper fixation or has been involved with alcoholics. We aim to portray the most realistic depiction of a high functioning alcoholic. We have spoken to recovering alcoholics and incorporated their experiences within the film."

                "The GodGrandpa is a drama inspired by the life of a real grandfather in 1980s Chinatown, Thailand, translated through the visual and emotional language of Hong Kong cinema of the same era. During that time, survival was not about chasing dreams, but about enduring hardship. With limited choices, my grandfather entered the underground casino world simply to keep his family alive. That lived experience became the foundation of this film.",
                "This story also explores the Chinese mindset of being “The Man” during that era. Men were expected to carry everything alone, money, pride, responsibility, and danger without complaint. Providing was love. Silence was strength. Mun, the lead character, represents a generation shaped by these expectations, where protecting the family meant sacrificing oneself, even at the cost of health, dignity, and relationships.",
                "Visually, the film honors the look, texture, and rhythm of 1980s Hong Kong cinema. It is cinematic yet raw, blending the grit of underground life with intimate, restrained emotion. Through this style, I want the audience to feel the weight of that time and the quiet strength of a generation that carried everything in silence.",
                "This film tells the truth of a universal experience. The GodGrandpa is our way of honoring these family members—in this case, a man who fought his entire life so that his family could survive.",
                "All cast and crew on this project are volunteers, with the entire team made up of film production students working under the university’s supervision and mentorship for this project.",
                "All donations will go toward catering, art, location rentals, and festival submissions. Because the film involves complex locations, one of which is a restaurant and a large cast, crew and background performers who require meals. We are currently short on budget to cover these essential costs.",

                "ACT 1: THE DINER AT DAWN",
                "The Double Eagle Diner, 1978. Frank and Marie, in their 70s, move through their silent, empty restaurant in a slow, tired routine. Frank stares at a wall of faded family photos.",
                "ACT 2: THE CONFESSIONAL - FRANK",
                "Direct-to-camera. Frank’s voice breaks. “We built this for them. But the kids… they have their own lives. If they don’t come home, we lose everything. Not just the business. The legacy.”",
                "ACT 3: THE CAVALRY ARRIVES",
                "A sleek SUV pulls into the empty lot. The HOST (Robert) and his three daughters—SOPHIE (Psychology), CHLOE (Art), and AVA (Real Estate)—exit, surveying the diner with professional detachment.",
                "ACT 4: THE AUDIT BEGINS",
                "The team fans out. AVA tours the property, taking notes on her tablet. SOPHIE sits with Frank and Marie, unpacking years of unspoken resentment. CHLOE sketches, reimagining the dated decor.",
                "ACT 5: THE BRUTAL TRUTH",
                "Robert pulls out a spreadsheet. \"The land's worth a lot. The business is broke.\" A silent tear rolls down Marie's cheek. The \"For Sale\" sign is leaning against the wall in the back office.",
                "ACT 6: THE HUNT - THE PRODIGALS",
                "We meet the kids. LEO, a cynical corporate manager in a sterile high-rise. ELLIE, a freelance graphic designer struggling in a cramped apartment. Both are unhappy, lost, and fiercely protective of their \"freedom.\"",
                "ACT 7: THE BRIDGE - CHLOE &amp; SOPHIE’S GAMBIT",
                "Chloe and Sophie meet Ellie at a park. They don’t mention the diner. Chloe shows her rebranding sketches for a fictional “heritage diner,” incorporating Ellie’s own art style. Ellie’s eyes light up for the first time.",
                "ACT 8: THE PROVOCATION - THE TECH SAVANT",
                "The team’s tech expert, JAX, arrives. He holds up the diner’s rotary phone and paper ticket system. “This isn’t nostalgia. It’s a museum. Your customers left for apps years ago.” Frank is insulted. Leo, watching via a video call, is intrigued.",
                "ACT 9: THE FAMILY MEETING - THE TWO FOLDERS",
                "The whole family gets together at the diner after closing. Robert puts two folders on the Formica counter. FOLDER A: A modern succession plan with Ellie's branding and a digital makeover. FOLDER B: A finalized sales contract and retirement brochures for Florida.",
                "ACT 10: THE SILENCE &amp; THE REACH",
                "A long minute goes by. Leo looks from his dad's worn hands to Ellie's hopeful face, to the sleek plans. He doesn't say anything. He just reaches out and pulls Folder A toward him.",
                "ACT 11: MONTAGE - THE REBUILD",
                "90 days later. A quick, uplifting montage: Ellie painting the new logo, Leo programming a new POS system, Frank teaching Leo the secret burger technique, Marie showing Ellie the books. The diner changes, mixing its soul with a new vision.",
                "ACT 12: THE SUNSET KEY",
                "It's the grand re-opening night, and the diner is packed. Leo's running the show, Ellie's hosting, and Frank and Marie are just watching from the door. Robert hands Frank the key, and Frank just puts it in Leo's hand. No goodbyes, just \"Open at 6 AM,\" Frank says. Then they walk out, hand-in-hand, into the sunset, leaving the lights on behind them.",
                "FINAL SHOT: The new neon sign, an eagle Ellie designed, is glowing bright and steady against the night. Not a flicker."

                "A beloved ramen from Yamagata, cherished by locals for many years, is now available in dried noodle form and ready to be enjoyed at your own table.",
                "There are two reasons we launched this project on Kickstarter.<br>The first is to share this unique local culture with the world and to show that even from a regional community, it is possible to reach a global audience, inspiring hope and courage in others.<br>The second is to reintroduce our products to Japan as “world-recognized items,” opening new overseas markets and shining a new light on our hometown.<br>For our backers, we have prepared special Kickstarter-exclusive sets and experience-based rewards. This project is not simply about selling products, it is about creating a lasting initiative that contributes to the continued revitalization of our region.",
                "The rich flavor perfected over many years is found in every morsel, from the soup to the noodles and the aroma.<br>The broth is deep and full-bodied, while the homemade noodles have a pleasantly chewy texture that hardly seems like dried noodles.<br>Even in the midst of a busy day, this bowl offers a nostalgic and comforting taste that gently soothes the heart.",
                "By just having a pack of these noodles, you can experience authentic noodles easily in your own home. Perfect as just a light snack, or if you feel cooking is a pain after a long day at the office, you can cook up some popular Japanese ramen and discover a taste sensation!&nbsp;",
                "Until now, we used the soy sauce specified by the manufacturer, but to allow everyone around the world to enjoy our flavor exactly as it is in our shop, we have switched to the soy sauce we actually use in our restaurant. This change ensures that you can experience the authentic taste of our ramen no matter where you are.",
                "The soup is a unique fusion of beef, bonito flakes, kelp, shiitake mushrooms, and two types of soy sauce, all mixed together to create a truly special flavor. Each ingredient’s natural umami is carefully drawn out, creating a rich and layered flavor. This bowl delivers a satisfying depth that keeps you enjoying every last sip. Please savor this carefully crafted bowl, made with our utmost dedication.",
                "Each serving of soup contains just 5 grams of fat, roughly one-third the fat of a popular tonkotsu ramen shop that creates its own packs that you can take home as souvenirs. Despite the lower fat, it delivers rich flavor and satisfying umami. This makes it an ideal bowl for those who want a delicious ramen while keeping health in mind. It is gentle on the stomach, perfect for those sensitive to richness, and can be enjoyed as a late-night meal without guilt.",
                "<br>&nbsp;",
                "Katsuobushi loses its aroma in just about 10 minutes after being shaved. Because we are a soba restaurant, we have the expertise to bring out its full natural fragrance and umami. In making soba broth, we use a unique method of simmering over high heat to extract every bit of flavor from the ingredients. This technique is also applied to our ramen, successfully drawing out the soup’s full depth of umami. Adding soy sauce further enhances the taste, giving the broth richness and sharpness for a more satisfying bowl.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Comparing the noodles to other types of noodles</span>",
                "Among the many types of ramen, shoyu, known in English as soy sauce, ramen stands out for striking the perfect balance between flavor and health.<br>Each serving contains only <span class=\"bold\">72 kcal</span> and <span class=\"bold\">5g of fat</span>, making it a lighter option without sacrificing richness or depth of taste. Despite its clean, refreshing profile, it delivers a satisfying umami that lingers with every bite.",
                "Furthermore, with <span class=\"bold\">3.2 g of protein</span>, it offers both nourishment and fullness. At <span class=\"bold\">6.1 g of salt</span> content, it has a lower salt content than that of miso or tonkotsu ramen, making it easier to enjoy as part of your daily meals without guilt.",
                "This is a bowl that embodies gentle comfort — light yet flavorful, simple yet deeply satisfying. Experience the pure, refined taste of soy sauce ramen, crafted to please both body and soul.",
                "A light yet deeply flavorful soy sauce ramen. It is gentle on the body while still offering a satisfying, full taste, so please try it for yourself!",
                "The noodles that are included in this set are the same that we use at our restaurant which uses the same ingredients and is made by the same artisans.&nbsp;<br>The wheat is carefully selected to match the texture of the fresh noodles, allowing you to enjoy an authentic experience at home that is indistinguishable from dining in.",
                "<br><br>Furthermore, the production of these dried noodles involves the same artisans who make the fresh noodles, meaning that they are well-versed in balancing the noodles with the soup for optimal texture and flavor. As a result, even as dried noodles, they achieve a seamless harmony with the soup, recreating the same quality as the ramen served in our restaurant.",
                "The story begins in the Taisho era, where, surrounded by the pristine waters of the Sagae River, fed by the melting snow of Mount Gassan, and rich natural surroundings, the third-generation Saraya Tarobe started making udon.",
                "The techniques this third-generation owner developed for udon and later for hiyamugi, which are thin wheat noodles, were passed down to the fourth-generation Saraya Tarobe in the Showa era. Determined to capture the authentic taste of Japanese soba in dried noodles, this fourth-generation Saraya Tarobe conducted extensive research and in 1960 launched the Tarobe Soba line.",
                "Today, the fifth-generation Saraya Tarobe continues the legacy of his predecessors. For over 100 years, spanning the 65 years since the Tarobe Soba’s launch, the family has devoted itself entirely to perfecting noodles. Driven by the desire to see smiles from those enjoying their noodles, they continue to dedicate themselves to producing dried noodles that bring joy to customers every day.",
                "The Base Ingredients",
                "<br>High-absorption medium-strong wheat flour is used to create noodles with firm texture and a pleasant, smooth mouthfeel.",
                "Mixing",
                "<br>Flour is kneaded into dough to maximize flavor.&nbsp;<br>The amount of water added is adjusted according to the conditions of the day.&nbsp;<br>Even for the same product, variations in weather, temperature, humidity, and ingredient quality can affect the dough.&nbsp;<br>Skilled artisans use their decades of experience and intuition to ensure the dough is always of the highest quality.",
                "Sheeting",
                "<br>The kneaded dough is passed multiple times through rolling machines to strengthen the texture while thinning it out. The dough is cut to the precise thickness while anticipating how it will change during drying.",
                "Drying",
                "<br>The finished noodles are then dried, trapping the flavor in the noodle.<br>Low-temperature drying over two days preserves texture and aroma. Artisans monitor temperature and humidity closely to ensure drying is neither too fast nor too slow.",
                "Cutting",
                "<br>The dried noodles are then cut to the best size that optimises their taste.<br>Careful checks are performed to ensure flavor is intact and the noodles are not brittle.",
                "Weighing<br>Short pieces and uneven ends are removed, and the noodles are weighed to the specified amount before packaging. Some of the finished ramen is taste-tested by artisans, and only those that pass are shipped as final products.",
                "In Yamagata, there is a local dish called “Imoni,” a soy sauce–based stew made with beef, taro, and other ingredients, cherished by the community for generations. We have taken care to honor this traditional flavor while reimagining it in the form of ramen. Among the many possible soup bases, such as tonkotsu or salt, we deliberately chose soy sauce to highlight the unique local taste of Yamagata.",
                "Yamagata Prefecture is said to have the highest consumption of soy sauce and ramen in Japan. For residents, the taste of soy sauce is deeply rooted in daily life and holds a special place in their hearts.",
                "This bowl of ramen carries the essence of Yamagata’s natural environment, the warmth of its people, and a deep respect for its food culture. For locals, it evokes nostalgia, while for visitors from other regions, it offers a fresh and delightful surprise, making it a truly special ramen.",
                "The soup is delicious! I’ve been eating it since a long time ago, but the char siu (specially cooked pork belly or loin) is also tasty!",
                "A cold broth, together with crisp, firm noodles, and seasonal toppings makes up Chilled Ramen, and not only perfect for summer, but this bowl can be enjoyed all year round. Its origin stems from a simple wish: to allow customers to enjoy ramen even in summer. Before air conditioning became common, our shop served shaved ice during the warmer months, and we used that ice to chill the broth, giving birth to chilled ramen.",
                "We continue to honor this traditional flavor while adapting it for modern lifestyles, making it easy to enjoy at home. Experience the taste of Yamagata’s climate and the dedication of our artisans in every bowl of chilled ramen, any time of year.",
                "The founder, determined to “make a living through the business of food,” began by making dumplings using a single stone mill, guided by the desire to become a place of support for the local community through food. This was the origin of Saraya Shokudo.",
                "Over time, the founder wondered, “Is there something more filling and easy to eat?” and began milling buckwheat with the stone mill. Meanwhile, after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, Chinese immigrants displaced from Yokohama’s Chinatown settled across Yamagata Prefecture and began serving ramen from street stalls, marking the beginnings of Yamagata’s ramen culture.",
                "Against this backdrop, our philosophy developed: to offer a meal that is nutritious, energizing, affordable, and delicious for everyone, one that satisfies not just the stomach but also the heart. It was this vision that led a soba shop like ours to begin serving Chuka Soba.",
                "The right side of our noren (shop banner) shows threads that have begun to fray. We see this as a symbol of the many people who have passed beneath it over the years. Each worn thread carries with it the weight of human presence and the passage of time.",
                "The memories and feelings of all who have visited seem to have gradually seeped into this right edge of the banner. For this reason, we cherish this “fraying” and intend to preserve it as a warm and welcoming entrance for everyone who comes through our doors.",
                "Our city, Sagae in Yamagata Prefecture, is known as Japan’s top cherry-producing region. Located near the center of Yamagata with a population of around 40,000, the city is surrounded by abundant nature and stunning seasonal landscapes, making it a hub for fruit and agricultural production.",
                "Sagae is especially famous for its cherries, boasting some of the highest production in the country. In early summer, jewel-like red cherries ripen, attracting visitors from all over Japan. The region’s clear water and distinct temperature differences between day and night create the ideal conditions for cherries with a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.",

                "Unfortunately, due to the President of the United States' Executive Order, which has stopped the De Minimis Policy of allowing shipping items under $800 to enter without needing to pay for import taxes, shipping via Japan Post is temporarily stopped. This means that we are looking at other ways of shipping to the US.&nbsp;",

We are still in the process of communicating with logistics on how we can ship, due to the nature of the product. In the event that we can't ship we will cancel all pledges to the US and refund after the project ends. We will inform everyone what will happen closer to the time.",
                "Also because we can't ship via Japan Post, this will mean that the cost of shipping may become quite costly. The chart below will only show a rough estimate and may become more costly. We'll try to keep backers up to date in this regard.",

                "Shipping is collected through PledgeBox at the end of the project. Please be aware that your initial pledge doesn't contain the price for shipping. We have done this as the commission that Kickstarter takes is based on the total raised on the project, which would need to be factored into the shipping prices. PledgeBox has much lower fees and thus is the cheaper way to collect shipping. We ask for your understanding in regard to how we are collecting shipping fees.",
                "Since there are more countries we can ship to rather than not, and Kickstarter doesn't have any way for us to distinguish what countries are exempt, so we'd literally have to list each country we can ship to, we have the setting for worldwide shipment to be possible. However, due to global situations, there is a small list of countries that we unfortunately can't ship to at this time.",

                "Thank you for being so kind and taking your time to read this. My name is Peter Denham, I am here from some google searches to be honest. I don't know much about crowdfunding but I do know about pizza. I make small batch sourdough pizzas. I started with finding a 20qt mixer, finding a starter I liked, and experimenting. I do have some background in the pizza business I was GM of Thats A Some Pizza located on Bainbridge Island, WA. I do have a massive amount of experience eating pizza. Something I must try when I travel is local pizzerias. I'm wanting us to bring amazing sourdough pizza that is healthy and locally sourced ingredients to work with our community. I have tons of community support already from friends and family to local business owners. By raising this money and having the ability to have a food truck that is complete and follows guidelines of the health department, we could make this happen. Be mobile opposed to having a brick n mortar would help me strive in my environment of traveling, meeting new people, creating new friendships, partnerships, and creating a great environment for people to get great pizza and enjoy time with friends, family, and strangers! Something personal to me is nursing homes, my grandparents adopted me when I was my daughters age now around 5 years old. I would love to be able to bring my food truck to the nursing homes, hospitals, and other places of that sort to bring something special to the people that may not get something like that anymore or often. Again, thank you truly for taking your time to read this and considering my dream.",

When health risks and ethical choices overlap, the mental load becomes constant.\r\nI’m not building this as a medical authority or a perfect database. I’m building it as a practical tool that prioritizes clarity, honesty, and caution especially in situations where missing or unclear information can actually cause harm.",

            "biography": "Hi, I’m Kris.\r\n\r\nBefore opening The Botanica Boutique, I was — and still am — a writer, and I was a New Jersey public school teacher. Storytelling, education, and helping people make sense of complex things have always been at the heart of my work. I’ve spent years listening closely — to students, to readers, and later, to a community searching for ways to feel better in a world that often feels overwhelming.\r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, that search became deeply personal. I’ve lived with anxiety for most of my life, and when the world slowed down, everything felt louder. I realized I wasn’t making space for myself, and that self-care wasn’t something optional — it was essential. Through that time, I turned toward plant-based remedies, ritual practices, and small, grounding habits that helped me sleep, think clearly, and feel more steady day to day.\r\n\r\nThat experience planted the seed for The Botanica Boutique.\r\n\r\nWhat began as a personal need grew into a vision: a wellness space rooted in care, intention, and trust. I immersed myself in research, herbal study, and the process of finding clean, thoughtfully made products from companies whose values aligned with my own — prioritizing plant-based ingredients, organic or regenerative practices, and women- and minority-owned businesses. Every product in the shop is personally vetted, because I believe wellness should feel supportive, not overwhelming.\r\n\r\nAs the shop grew, one thing became clear: people weren’t just looking for products. They were looking for moments of care — rituals that could help them slow down, breathe, and reconnect with themselves in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThat’s where The Ritual Collection was born.\r\n\r\nThis small-batch line of organic herbal teas is a natural extension of the work I’ve been doing for years — blending herbs with intention, listening deeply, and honoring the power of simple rituals. Each blend is designed to support everyday moments like rest, focus, calm, emotional balance, and seasonal shifts. I also offer custom teas, blended thoughtfully for individual preferences and needs.\r\n\r\nThe Ritual Collection represents the next chapter of my work — one rooted in ritual, community, and the belief that wellness doesn’t have to be complicated to be meaningful.\r\n\r\nThank you for being here, and for supporting this journey.",

S4 Ultimate comes with the Special Feature Shriek correct?  I don't see option to add it on and I recall a previous Season getting the North Pole w/ the Ultimate pledge (actually almost a year early if I recall correctly).  If it doesn't come with it and can't add it on does that mean I can't get it through this campaign?  (that would be very odd).  Thanks in advance for providing clarity",

Much like with regular D&amp;D sizes, we've considered the area occupied by the ship a sort of maximum space it takes to fight effectively, which includes room for wings, engines, and other non-explorable parts of the ship. And even that leaves room for some insanely large battlemaps! So when it comes to the Czepeku maps, I'm sort of scaling down a bit for sanity's sake, but we can easily imagine a Transport-size ship being dramatically larger."

                "We are <span class=\"bold\">The Big Science Project</span>, a small team based in the heart of Mid Wales. Our mission is simple: to make science accessible, inclusive, and entirely unintimidating for everyone.",
                "Until now, we’ve focused on creating educational books, home kits, and running live events to help children see the wonder in the world. But we realised something, kids shouldn't get to have all the fun! Many of our team’s best memories are built around after-work games nights, so merging the world of science with social play felt like a natural evolution. <span class=\"bold\">Molecule Mayhem</span> is our way of bringing adults (and families) into the fold while staying true to our core ethos: clear language, inclusive design, and learning through laughter.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Scenario:</span> Welcome to the world’s most prestigious - and most chaotic -chemistry laboratory. You and your fellow chemists have been tasked with a monumental challenge: assembling the complex chemical structures that power our world. But there is a catch. The lab is short on supplies, the equipment is temperamental, and your rivals are just as determined to claim the Nobel Prize as you are!",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Chaos:</span> In this lab, a steady hand and a sharp mind are your best tools. One moment you are perfectly bonding Hydrogen and Oxygen to create life-sustaining water; the next, a Molecule Mayhem event sends your research flying across the room. Safety goggles aren't just a recommendation - they’re your only hope when the experiments start to bubble over!",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Your Mission:</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Race to Build:</span> Be the first to complete your chemistry goals.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">Survive the Mayhem:</span> Navigate the sabotage, accidental explosions, and the \"Element of Surprise\" to emerge as the lead scientist.",
                "Being based in Mid Wales, we are passionate about supporting our local heritage and making science accessible in more than one language. We are thrilled to announce that <span class=\"bold\">Molecule Mayhem will be available in both English and Welsh.</span> Every backer will have the opportunity to choose their preferred language version after the campaign concludes.",
                "We have spent months refining the games mechanics, testing the balance of the cards, and perfecting the artwork and colour scheme. Now, we are ready to bring <span class=\"bold\">Molecule Mayhem</span> to life, but we need your help to cross the finish line.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We are raising funds to:</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Kickstart our first major print run:</span> Your support will allow us to manufacture the game at scale, ensuring high-quality components and sustainable packaging from a UK based company.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Stock for Schools &amp; Stores:</span> Beyond just this campaign, we want to get this game into the hands of educators and local retailers. These funds will provide the initial inventory needed to begin distributing to schools and science clubs across the UK, helping us break into the wider market.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Logistics &amp; Distribution:</span> Funding will help us establish the shipping and storage infrastructure required to get the game from our Welsh headquarters to your front door efficiently.",
                "At its heart, <span class=\"bold\">Molecule Mayhem</span> is a social experience designed to bring friends and family together for a brilliant games night. Whether you're at the pub, gathered around the dinner table, or enjoying a rainy afternoon at home, the focus always remains on the laughter, the competition, and the shared experience of play.",
                "Because the mechanics are intuitive and the language is clear, the educational side is simply a fantastic added bonus. This makes it just as effective in a classroom or a science club as it is in a living room; teachers and group leaders can pick it up and lead a session confidently without needing a PhD. It creates a relaxed space where you happen to pick up science facts while you’re busy trying to win!",
                "The availability of a Welsh-language edition also makes this an ideal resource for bilingual classrooms and clubs. It creates a relaxed space where students and families can explore science in the language they feel most comfortable using, ensuring the focus remains on participation, laughter, and shared experience."

I have been active in the IT industry since 2000, building large-scale portal solutions with a strong focus on robustness, scalability, and long-term maintainability. Over the years, I have deepened my expertise around Java EE and JBoss-based stacks, working on complex environments where integration and reliability are critical.\r\n\r\nI am responsible for defining portal architectures, choosing the most suitable technologies, and guiding development teams throughout the software lifecycle. I work to translate business requirements into concrete technical solutions, establishing standards and best practices that ensure security, performance, and ease of evolution over time. Daily, I collaborate with developers, operations, and stakeholders, acting as a bridge between strategic objectives and implementation details.\r\n\r\nBeyond my day-to-day work, I contribute to the Java community through open-source initiatives and technical writing. I am the author of “Mastering Java EE Development with WildFly,” where I share practical guidance for building enterprise-grade applications based on real-world experience. Over time I have worked with and around platforms such as Apache, Alfresco, and Atlassian, which has helped me develop a pragmatic mindset focused on delivering reliable, maintainable systems that can grow with the needs of the business.",

You've already heard many of these songs, you've been asking for them, I've been playing them live... and you deserve them right now!",
                "As you know, I'm 100% independent. That comes with a lot of creative freedom, which I love, but having no label also means that every part of making an album has to be funded by me, which is the main reason it’s taken so long to get new music out.",
                "For this album, I’ll still be covering a large portion of the costs myself, but this Kickstarter is about giving the project an initial boost - so instead of waiting another three years, I can give you Album #2 THIS YEAR!",

                "I am SO excited to start this process and have you involved every step of the way! It's been so fun getting to know you more and more over the last few months, both online and at live shows, and I'm so grateful for your support I can't even begin to explain.&nbsp;",

                "20 Years after I should have flown around the world with my band on the World Tour - A project that ended up as a disaster - I decided that this was unfinished business and decided to finally take them on a proper circumnavigation. I've had a couple of hits, made a movie and had two autobiographies, but not yet toured the world with my band, which of course I need to do in order to call myself a proper Rock Star.",
                "Turns out that March 2026 coincides with the thirty three and a third anniversary of the band. Yes, we've been together that long without a line-up change, which is some sort of long playing record. Hence the idea of recording an LP with one side recorded in the Southern hemisphere and the other in the Northern hemisphere. It will also be available as a CD.",
                "It has been 10 years since Montserrat, the last studio album we recorded together, so I reckon it's time to have a go at another. As well as the gigs, studios have been booked in Vancouver, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.&nbsp;",
                "Travelling with us on the tour to film the adventure is Steve Barker (who directed \"Otway the Movie\") and David Painter, a cameraman who has just filmed \"Seven Marathons in Seven Continents In Seven Days\".",
                "One of the books that had a huge influence on me before my career began was Ian Hunter's \"<span class=\"text-italic\">Diary Of A Rock And Roll Star\"</span>&nbsp;- A chronicle of Mott The Hoople's 1972 tour of America. So I'm also writing a diary to cover this project. It might not be as influential as Ian's book, but I have had a really good reaction to the two books I've written and hopefully this one will please and amuse you too.",
                "The crowdfunder package is any combination of the Picture Disc, Paperback, DVD, and CD. If anyone is interested, I'll also include handwritten lyrics (as they proved really popular when we crowdfunded the Montserrat Album) and a couple of other amusing bits from the upcoming tour. All the artwork for the album and book etc. that I've included on these pages are for guidance only to give an idea of what we are producing, with the final designs to be revealed later.&nbsp;",
                "This whole project is costing me a fortune - So if you fancy helping by pre-ordering anything that you fancy, it will severely lessen the ouch and be really appreciated."

                "In 2022, I shared the news that I’d signed a record deal for my album <span class=\"text-italic\">Better By Now</span>. About a year after its release, the label decided to drop me. The reason they gave is that it hadn’t generated enough streaming revenue (a reminder that Spotify pays roughly $.004 per stream). I had hoped for a long-term partnership, one that would support making music for years to come. Instead of giving it more time and believing in my music, things ended abruptly and sent me back to square one. I had to rediscover why I make music in the first place.",
                "So here I am with no team and no funding. Just me, doing it all, and redefining what “all” means every single day.",
                "The surprising part? This process has made me feel like a kid again. After more than 20 years of making music, I’m learning new things constantly, getting deeply inspired by the craft in a way I haven’t felt in years.",
                "After months of coaching and continued mentoring from the phenomenal Christian “Leggy” Langdon (producer of <span class=\"text-italic\">Better By Now</span>), and countless hours of meticulous work since, I’ve grown more than I ever expected. It’s been slow, quiet, sometimes invisible growth, but I hope you’ll <span class=\"text-italic\">hear</span> it in the songs.",
                "These songs are the most hands-on, personal work I’ve ever made. I’m incredibly proud of them and genuinely excited to share them with you. I've given this project literally everything I've got, and I'm not going to stop now.&nbsp;",

I’m watching the government murder citizens and grab children from the street and being told it’s lawful. I can’t look away. But my heart can’t take anymore. I also cannot pretend that something dark isn’t happening.",
                "<br>It's a crazy time in the world. Honestly, I feel quite ridiculous promoting my work in the middle of the chaos unfolding daily. I do not agree with the current US administration's actions, even if most days I don't know what to do. I believe in freedom and human rights. I believe in empathy and kindness. I also believe that we all need to do what keeps us sane and softhearted, so we can keep fighting the good fight. Music keeps me sane. It provides a little bit of light in the dark. It connects people. I want to connect with you."

                "Hi! We are Tau Ensemble - a German-Israeli world-fusion band, formed in 2022 in the heart of the Negev desert by five musician friends:<br>Miri, Jonas, Or, Almog, and Nadav.<br><br>This spring we want to bring our new Album \"Bridges“ alive - by producing it professionally and manufacturing an physical Album. Our intention is to build bridges and inspire our community to do so as well.&nbsp;<br>Bridges between tradition and modernity, between the inner and the outer world, bridges between people. Creating space for peace, honesty, authenticity, cultural exchange and healing.",
                "Coming from different cultural and musical backgrounds in the Middle East and Europe, we met at the Internal Compass Institute in Mitzpe Ramon, southern Israel, with the same intention: Fully committing to developing our skills in music.<br><br>&nbsp;",
                "Our music was born from the silence, vastness, and raw landscapes of the desert. In this timeless environment, listening became a central part of the creative process; listening to the land, to one another, and to the sounds that emerged between us.<br><br>Initially being jazz students, we soon discovered our mutual fascination with \"Maqam\" - the modal system at the heart of much Middle Eastern music. What began as curiosity quickly deepened into a dedicated and ongoing artistic collaboration.",
                "Over the past four years, we have:",
                "Our upcoming album, <span class=\"text-italic\">Bridges</span>, is a natural continuation of this journey - and a deeper exploration of it.<br>Musically, the album weaves together:",
                "In this live session you can get an idea of how this might sound like:",
                "<br>But “Bridges” is not only a musical connection - it is also a deeply human one.<br>With our music we aim to go beyond geographic, cultural and political divides to create a common space in which openness and honest exchange can exist naturally.&nbsp;",
                "The album will feature the voices of Israeli and Palestinian children, sharing their thoughts about what they would need in order to cross a metaphorical “bridge” to the other side. These short, honest reflections will be embedded in our music throughout the album as a subtle emotional thread, offering a sincere, human perspective that anchors the music in the reality in which Tau was born and continues to exist.&nbsp;<br>The voices do not aim to explain or resolve - they simply remind us why bridges are needed in the first place.",
                "Just like each piece of music carries a story that can only be understood by listening carefully, so does each culture and each human being carry its own truth that reveals itself when we are patient and persistent enough to look beyond outer appearances.<br>By making these principles audible with our music, we invite you to keep your ears and hearts open as the music itself turns into the bridge on which we meet in authenticity.",
                "By supporting this campaign, you are not only helping us record an album -<br>you are enabling us to work with professionals we deeply respect, and to offer our community the best possible listening experience. By that, you help us bringing our vision of building bridges alive.",
                "“Bridges” will be recorded in March 2026, and we have chosen to create it independently in order to preserve full artistic freedom - and to give this music the best possible sonic home for our listeners.",
                "After taking a deeper look into the production processes of our favorite artists, all paths led us to the same source: <span class=\"bold\">Shahar Kaufman</span> of <a href=\"https://onyx-studio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onyx Studio</a>, renowned for enhancing the warm, natural, and transparent sound we were searching for.<br><br>At the moment, Shahar is based in Portugal, where he runs a studio surrounded by nature and serenity. This added logistical layer is part of our choice to not compromise on quality, and to create “Bridges” in the best possible way.<br>&nbsp;",
                "All the extra funds will flow into one of these projects:",
                "We chose to crowdfund this project because we believe in creating this album together with our community.",
                "This is an all-or-nothing project:<br>If we reach our goal, the album can come to life.<br>If we don’t, the project cannot move forward in this form.<br>This also means that you will only get your reward and pay the money for it if we successfully finished our campaign.<br><br><br>Therefore every contribution - big or small - truly matters.<br>&nbsp;",
                "To appreciate your support, we’ve created a range of rewards:",

                "Three years ago, Stunt Double was just a dream, a crazy idea. &nbsp;As cliche as it sounds, that's just the honest truth. &nbsp;Elaina Alston wanted to create a band in the Rochester scene that stood out from the rest. &nbsp;Jam Bands, Cover Bands and Jazz make up the demand of the scene and she wanted a group that could do all three at the same time. &nbsp;Finding the talents of musicians along the way helped the band carve out a unique sound filled with funk, soul, blues, R&amp;B and new roots! &nbsp;Soaring vocal harmonies, spontaneous jams and groove driven vibes are the driving force in any live performance for Stunt Double. Last year, the band made a return to the Rochester Lilac Festival and premiered their new original songs. &nbsp;After such positive reactions from the crowd, the band decided to pivot into the direction of creating a debut album to showcase their hard work. &nbsp;Creating any musical work is no small feat and an album is no different. &nbsp;Songwriting and Studio sessions take countless time, energy and dedication for any project with the goal of creating original work. &nbsp;Stunt Double has experienced so much growth since the beginning and this debut album would cement their place and build a foundation for their future as musicians in Rochester and beyond. &nbsp; There are hopes that this album will reach new areas allowing for the band to tour later this year. With your contribution, Stunt Double moves forward with their goals as professional musicians!&nbsp;"

The band got a taste of the deep corruption of the entertainment scene in Chicago and the creepy hand of Organized Crime which hung over everything like a poison gas. The details of this part of the story are rather grotesque and definitely not to be repeated here.",

The house had been tenanted previously by The Dadistics, another outsider band on the scene. We found copies of their single sleeves scattered around the house. And needles.",
                "In February of 1979, a year after meeting, on a bitter cold night in a van with a broken heater—our legs wrapped in blankets and plastic trash bags—a song came on the radio and the opening bassline of Joy Division's \"Transmission\" started up. As I listened to the way the song developed and the way it sounded, I <span class=\"bold\">KNEW</span> that I was hearing the sound of the future, and I knew I wanted STATIONS to be part of that sound, part of that future. We put together some songs and started rehearsing with Greg DeLap on keyboards, Stevo Georgiafandis on drums, and Dexter Veka on bass.",
                "We recorded two songs at Studiomedia in Evanston and produced our own single, putting it out on the (unregistered) DuVall Records in August of 1979. It was the era of the end of Stadium Rock. John Bonham died; Led Zeppelin announced their retirement and put out their last record about the same time we put out our first. Zeppelin's last single \"Fool in the Rain\" sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Stations' first single \"Against the Grain\" sold, well, a few hundred.",
                "I bought the Joy Division LP <span class=\"text-italic\">Unknown Pleasures</span> and discovered the name of the producer, <span class=\"bold\">Martin Hannett</span>, and began seeking out any record with his name on it. George discovered the name of the London distributor of Factory Records, Pinnacle Entertainment in Orpington (Bromley), London. We sent a copy of the STATIONS single to Martin Hannett c/o Factory Records c/o Pinnacle Entertainment. Somehow it made it into his hands and ears. We had thrown a piece of plastic across the Atlantic Ocean hoping it would land in Manchester, and somehow it did.",
                "Some months later, if my memory serves it was in March of 1980, we got a call at the Bloomingdale house. A fellow with a pronounced Mancunian accent who identified himself as <span class=\"bold\">Martin Usher</span>, \"a friend of Hannett's,\" was hoping to stop by for a visit. \"I'm calling from a Vienna restaurant,\" (calling that place a restaurant was a very kind thing) \"but having trouble finding your address.\" Our place was stuck between an ancient railroad siding and an alley; no street access. We gave him instructions and he stopped by.",
                "Soon we were sitting down with Martin Usher, who was not only a friend of Hannett's but a skilled engineer who wound up building the gear that would make New Order's sound possible some months later. Usher was and is one of the most brilliant computer heads one could ever hope to meet. Some months later he invited us to visit Manchester during the Christmas Boxing Day holiday of 1981. England was in the throes of Thatcherism and celebrating the marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Strange Days had found us.",
                "In the meantime, things were changing at the Speed of Life for us. Stevo left to join Al Jourgensen's new band <span class=\"bold\">Ministry</span>; Dexter and Greg moved out west. Our sculptor friend David Kotker brought <span class=\"bold\">Steve Albini</span> to meet us at the Bloomingdale house and we did a few months' work with him, doing demos on cassette and playing one gig with him at the old Exit on Wells Street on December 17th, 1981. It was at this time we acquired a <span class=\"bold\">Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer</span> and began using it. I found that I could trigger stuff off the TR-808 through my <span class=\"bold\">ARP 2600</span> three-oscillator analog synth, and that opened up a whole new texture for us.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/416/442/9805c25bb732c2c25169b5e287b7d723_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1769838176&amp;width=2560&amp;sig=MoMQlFvWhfOox4D%2F%2FCldV4SpDKoEQofBd6caJdtlDtI%3D\" data-id=\"52416442\"> We played that one gig at Exit with Steve Albini on a night upon which there was a vicious ice storm in Chicago, but still the place was packed. Not a horrible gig; we even did a cover of John Cooper Clarke's \"Strange Bedfellows\" and a little Lotte Lenya for good measure. But things didn't work out with Steve Albini. Steve liked to play his bass with the treble cranked all the way up, more in the guitar and vocal range of frequencies than the bass, so it became a really midrange-dominant sound. George and I both felt that Steve would take off better doing his own sound, and it turned out he did just that with <span class=\"bold\">Big Black.</span><img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/416/435/2e12d43d23154c7b8b775ba1254849c6_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1769838026&amp;width=1440&amp;sig=Uo%2BRFCd76dauwCBzMvKKS0OhsgovbMZdeBkQ6LtqMlg%3D\" data-id=\"52416435\">",
                "George and I kept scouring other bands for drummers and bass players. Frank Brodlo was working with a few different bands, including The Cunts and Painter Band. John Elliot was in Chicago working, and we managed to convince both of them to join STATIONS. We began working in earnest, writing new material rapidly and getting ready to play live gigs. In my mind, that was the best iteration of Stations: Frank, John, George, and David. We just clicked.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/416/436/c2ed89fce23ce972e782855252257210_original.jpeg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1769838027&amp;width=4032&amp;sig=DBHGgjn5a9qGPLNIPhb54s97%2BRMyvPqOFIJXSss7lIg%3D\" data-id=\"52416436\">",
                "We played better venues—Tut's on Belmont, Cabaret Metro, and multiple shows at the 950 Club (also known as Lucky Number). We were asked to do the support slot for <span class=\"bold\">Joy Division</span> at Tut's on May 27th, 1980. All the musicians and music fans in Chicago were excited, none more than we, but it was not to be. Ian Curtis killed himself on May 18th, 1980, in Manchester, just nine days before the Chicago gig. Everybody was crushed. The gig had been sold out for weeks. Joy Division was no more.",
                "So, in the summer of 1982, Martin Hannett and Susanna O'Hara (code name Susanna O'Hooligan) flew to Chicago and we did the three-song session for the proposed EP at Studiomedia in Evanston. That same weekend we played a backup slot at Cabaret Metro behind <span class=\"bold\">Killing Joke</span>, and Hannett did live sound for us. Killing Joke got paid in little bags of smack. I asked Joey Shanahan for cash for our fee. STATIONS wasn't a drug band at all; a tall can of beer at the end of rehearsal was our limit.",
                "Hannett, on the other hand, was a down-for-the-crown smackhead, \"chasing the dragon\" as they say. It was a stretch for us to score gear for Hannett, and led to some weirdness, but all in all, it was exciting to have Martin in Chicago working with us. Smack or not, Martin had great ears and was a wickedly smart and talented musician and bassist, and a likable, generous guy. How many artists did he encourage and promote? The Buzzcocks, Magazine, John Cooper Clarke, The Psychedelic Furs, The Only Ones, Durutti Column, Nico, The Names, ESG, Stations, and Happy Mondays, to name a few.",
                "He had a slightly bemused, slightly manic, slightly cynical sense of humor. One thing about producing artists—you can try molding them, scolding them, or controlling them, or just finding and bringing forward something they themselves aren't aware of in their work. Martin was ready to jump in and help, ready to experiment until something started to click. I only wish we could have done more with him. I remember sitting in the control room with him; he was looking around at all the effects and processors and he turned to me and said:",

                "<span class=\"bold\">The Physician's Desk Reference</span> (in order to determine what might cover for smack from the tourist crap that might turn up. No fool there.)",
                "I think I told him that I thought he was nuts, but he wasn't. He was right. He saw the compressed, sterile, ugly, inhuman future of popular entertainment 41 years ago and tried to warn me about it.",
                "We did the three songs—<span class=\"bold\">\"Climate of Violence,\"</span> <span class=\"bold\">\"Demonstration,\"</span> and <span class=\"bold\">\"In Defense of Cosmetics\"</span>—and Martin and Susanna scampered back to Manchester with the 24-track master on 2-inch tape. Eventually, Martin sent us a cassette of his mixes, done at Strawberry Studios in Stockport (former studio home of 10cc).",
                "This project sat frozen for forty-four years. What you're listening to now has been heard by less than 20 people in the entire span of its existence. The almost illegible underside of the crumpled box of Fascist Candy Corn of Ronald Reagan and Maggie Thatcher.",

                "My name is Lil Scotty, and I’m creating an album called Don’t Poke the Bear with my friend and collaborator Lil Lysol, under our independent label Bear Gang Records.",
                "This project started as a challenge I’ve carried with me for years. I’ve always wanted to create an album in 24 hours — something raw, instinctive, and impossible to overthink. I’ve always believed the best art comes from pressure, momentum, and trusting your first instinct.",
                "Life made me realize 24 hours wasn’t realistic, but I refused to let the idea die. Instead of giving up on it, I expanded the challenge to 7 days. Same urgency. Same intensity. Just enough space to do it right without losing the raw energy that made the idea special in the first place.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What “Don’t Poke the Bear” Means to Us</span>",
                "The title Don’t Poke the Bear is playful on the surface, but it carries a deeper meaning for us. It represents being underestimated, staying calm, and knowing when to move. We don’t need to be loud to be confident — but once tested, we stand our ground.",
                "That energy defines Bear Gang Records. We’re not forcing attention. We’re building something real, on our own terms, with people we trust.",
                "This album reflects that balance between humor and confidence. It’s fun, it’s honest, and it’s unapologetically us.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Why Bear Gang Records Exists</span>",
                "Bear Gang Records isn’t a traditional label. It’s a foundation built by friends who believe in each other’s creativity. There are no executives, no corporate rules — just accountability, trust, and shared vision.",
                "Every decision on this album is being made by the people creating it. That freedom allows us to take risks, keep the music honest, and capture moments as they happen instead of polishing the life out of them.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">How We’re Creating the Album</span>",
                "We’re committing to creating, recording, and finishing Don’t Poke the Bear in 7 days.",
                "That means trusting our instincts, writing fast, recording while the energy is fresh, and letting moments live even if they’re imperfect. Some songs will come together in a single session. Others will evolve naturally over the week.",
                "The time limit forces honesty. It forces focus. It keeps us present.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Why We’re Asking for Support</span>",
                "Even when you’re independent, creating an album still comes with real costs — studio time, mixing, mastering, artwork, distribution, and promotion all add up.",
                "This GoFundMe exists to help us bring Don’t Poke the Bear to life without compromising the vision behind it. Every contribution goes directly into finishing the album the right way and making sure it reaches people who connect with the energy.<br>&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What This Album Represents</span>",
                "Don’t Poke the Bear represents a moment in time for both of us. It’s about trusting ourselves, working together, and proving that creativity doesn’t need permission.",
                "This album is a statement from Bear Gang Records — not just about music, but about independence, community, and building something real from the ground up.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Thank You for Being Part of This</span>",
                "Whether you donate, share, or just take the time to read this, we appreciate you more than we can say. Your support helps us turn a raw idea into a finished project and move one step closer to our vision.",
                "Don’t poke the bear.",

                "For the past few years I’ve been quietly dreaming and writing an album called <span class=\"text-italic\">from my heart… </span>It began as a private thing. A place to hold the parts of life that don’t fit on stage or online. Somewhere along the way it became bigger. It became about becoming; about the quiet miracle of being alive, about grief and gratitude, about understanding yourself after surviving the things you’ve survived.",
                "This album isn’t a performance. It’s the most honest and vulnerable thing I’ve ever made.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">from my heart…</span> only exists because of the life I’ve lived up to this moment. I’m at a point in my life and career where I finally have something to say and the tools to say it. If I wait, it becomes another story. I believe this is the moment to tell it, and to tell it fully.",
                "This project is about listening to that quiet inner voice that says: <span class=\"text-italic\">this matters now.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">from my heart…</span> is a solo cello album with orchestra, choir, and more. It moves like a film score, breathes like chamber music, and feels like late-night reflection. It’s not about virtuosity. It’s about interiority; the quiet things we live through, understand, and continue from.",
                "The cello serves as the narrator. The orchestra becomes breath and environment. The choir is there to elevate meaning.",
                "This album is for anyone who has lived, loved, lost, healed, wondered, or continued. It’s for people who pay attention to the quiet things. It’s for people who feel deeply but don’t always know how to say it. It’s for people still learning how to be alive.",
                "To make this album the way it needs to be made; with a real orchestra, a real choir, and real musicians in the room, I need help. Recording orchestral music at this scale is expensive. It’s also worth it.&nbsp;",
                "I’m asking for partnership. If you choose to support this project, you’re not just helping me make an album. You’re helping bring something honest and beautiful into the world.",

I’m writing, orchestrating, arranging, copying parts, and producing this album myself to ensure it stays true to its intention.

                "This isn’t content for promotion. It’s a record of how the album came to life.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">$90,000 — Mixing and mastering at the highest level</span>",
                "At this level, we can bring in additional expertise and time for mixing and mastering to ensure the album translates beautifully across all listening environments; headphones, speakers, quiet rooms, and large spaces.",
                "The goal here is longevity: an album that sounds as good ten years from now as it does on first listen.",

                "This is the dream version.",

                "In Hildegard Reanimated: Vision in Vision, The Pandora Consort explores the mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen through her illuminations and music. Taking inspiration from her life, we weave them together in a concert program focused on four of her most famous visions that influenced her spiritual philosophy. Working with visual artist Cate Duckwall to bring these visions to life, this concert features music from Hildegard’s vast oeuvre accompanied by artistic animations of key illuminations, creating a multimedia experience.",
                "Our love for Hildegard's music comes directly from our mentor and friend, Pamela Dellal. She has taught us everything we know about singing Hildegard – the rules (and how to break them), the deep mind-body connection one must cultivate to really do it <span class=\"text-italic\">right</span>, and the utter joy the process can bring. This music is simultaneously human and otherworldly; it's something you've heard before and something you haven't all at once. Thank you, Pam, for helping us access it.&nbsp;",
                "We sing this program in the coolest places: in dusty basements, at small independent bookstores, in stone chapels, in huge and tiny churches, at art galleries, on the radio, during yoga classes, in poetry publishing houses, on Broadway. We meet and befriend the coolest people doing this work: Elaine and Chandler, Laura and Meyer, Helen, Josh, Nancy, Karlye, Alexandre, Bianca and Ben, Jane and Will, Emily, Gene, Dennis, Christine.&nbsp;",

                "<br><span class=\"bold\">Thanks for visiting! </span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Moments of Japan</span></span><span class=\"bold\"> is a photobook curating a collection of street scenes I captured across Japan between 2023–2025. More than just a visual record, it’s my personal reflection on the atmosphere and energy of Japan’s streets at night.</span>",
                "This all began in March 2023, on my first trip exploring Kantō, Chūbu, Kansai, and Chūgoku. Like many, I was drawn in by the food, culture and hospitality — but what stayed with me most was the contrast; <span class=\"bold\">neon and noise</span> on the surface, with <span class=\"bold\">moments of stillness</span> hidden away in the quiet backstreets.&nbsp;<br><br>That visit left a lasting impression. So I returned, twice more over the following years, discovering new places and slowly building what would become this book.<br><br>Since then, I’ve been sharing glimpses on Instagram, <span class=\"bold\">but I always felt the images deserved something more tangible. A slower, quieter space to breathe.</span><br><br>That’s what Moments of Japan is. A curated photobook threading together night-time scenes, from cosy corners in Kyoto to the neon chaos of Tokyo. It's not a guidebook or a misleading photoshopped fantasy, but an honest attempt to capture the presence and atmosphere of the in-between.<br><br>Above all, it’s my way of honouring a place I’ve come to care about deeply. And with your support, turning these scenes into something lasting.",
                "The core reward is the First Edition casebound photobook featuring 86 carefully selected images across 160 pages, divided into six thematic chapters including <span class=\"bold\">Light 灯</span>, <span class=\"bold\">Flow</span> <span class=\"bold\">流れ</span>, and <span class=\"bold\">Solitude 孤独</span>. Each chapter explores a different visual thread using minimal text and clean layouts to let each scene breathe.",
                "I'm designing the book to feel quiet and immersive. Something you can return to slowly, page by page. And to ensure it's created with the utmost quality, I'll be working with a professional UK book printer to produce a <span class=\"bold\">beautifully crafted edition</span> you'll be proud to display.",

This includes a raised gold foil title, a custom designed Obi Strip, and other carefully chosen embellishments like Japanese patterned endpapers, heavier stock, a reading ribbon, and head &amp; tail binding bands.",

In recent years photography has become an equally important creative outlet for me. It’s a way of observing the world more slowly and noticing the details we usually pass by.",
                "That slower pace deepened during my time in Japan, especially at night. There’s something about the atmosphere: the quiet, the chaos, the mix of stillness and movement. I’ve been documenting these scenes for three years which now form the heart of this book.<br><br><span class=\"text-italic\">Moments of Japan</span> brings together my love of Japanese culture, observational photography, and printed design.

                "Inspired by Shibari is a photobook, video and painting project.",
                "Shibari, also known as Kinbaku is an ancient art from Japan. Originally used as a method of restraining captives, then it evolved as a form of art. The literal meaning of Kinbaku is \"the beauty of tight binding\". Nowadays this form of art is practised worldwide.",
                "Me as an artist was first introduced to Shibari in Asia, where professional Shibari performers made live shows, then I saw photographers in France and UK. This was a great inspiration for me to practise this form of art both in photography and painting.",

                "Hi everyone. This is Yoana, a 27-year-old Dominican amateur model. I'm sure you remember her from <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/967222541/artistic-nude-and-boudoir-photobook-yoana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year campaign</a> and her <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/967222541/project-undermask-art-nude-photography-yoana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first campaign</a>. This is the 4th time I work with her and we did this photoshoot a couple of hours before my flight back home.<br><br>This campaign will have 150+ photos in color and a 60 page eBook and physical book (magazine).&nbsp;If you already own rewards from her <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/967222541/project-undermask-art-nude-photography-yoana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/967222541/artistic-nude-and-boudoir-photobook-yoana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2025</a> campaigns, then you can get any of these rewards:<br><br><span class=\"bold\">eBook - $20</span><br><span class=\"bold\">eBook and Photo Set - $50</span><br><span class=\"bold\">Photobook + eBook + Photo Set - $80</span><br><br>If you want to get some or all of her rewards from previous campaign, please select them at the \"add-ons\" while making your pledge.",
                "Below &nbsp;you can see samples of what you will get. Please note that these photos are in low quality and censored for publication purposes. Send me an email or message if you would like to see them uncensored.",
                "<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Thank you for your support!</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Why I need the money?</span> Your contribution will help me pay the models and all the expenses I had for this photo shoot.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">How old are the models? </span>All models participating in this project are 18 years old or older.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Do models sign a model release?</span> Yes, all models participating in this project sign a model release.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Is this porn? </span>Absolutely not. There is no sex or penetration of any kind. I see&nbsp;nudity as an art. Please Keep&nbsp;in mind&nbsp;that most photos are uncensored,&nbsp;but absolutely no pornography.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Printed Softcover Photobook:</span>&nbsp; It's a softcover photobook/magazine, 8.5x11 inches, 60 pages in color.&nbsp;The reason I chose magazine, and not hardcover book, is because a&nbsp;magazine is less expensive to make, print and ship. It still&nbsp;has&nbsp;very good quality and the photos looks amazing.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">Delivering the rewards:</span> I will send the rewards to the email &nbsp;associated with your&nbsp;kickstarter account. The&nbsp;link to download the rewards will expire after a couple of days &nbsp;you receive it. If you want &nbsp;me to send the link to a different email&nbsp;I&nbsp;will gladly do it. Just &nbsp;send me a message with the new email after you pledge for a reward. Please understand that for&nbsp;security reasons I can't keep the link permanent. After sending rewards and moving to a different campaign, I cannot guarantee delivery of rewards weeks or months after sending the first email.&nbsp;If for any reason&nbsp;you&nbsp;didn't receive the email or can't download the rewards&nbsp;please contact&nbsp;me asap.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">International Backers:</span> Delivering physical rewards to countries outside of United States is extremely expensive. My suggestion for you is to use a freight forwarder like VIABOX, FISHISFAST, SHIPITO (among others, check your country first), that way I can ship it to freight forwarder address in the United States and the cost for you will be much lower. If you need more information about freight forwarder, please contact me before backing this project.",
                "If you still want the book shipped using the regular USPS services, I included the option as well. The price for shipping to other countries is $45 dollars."

It's one of the last standing havens of a simpler life, where technology barely makes a dent in the everyday, and folks are encouraged to slow down and connect.",
                "Our team is composed of photographers from North Carolina, and we’ve spent our whole lives coming back to this coastline. Capturing it on film - the dunes, lighthouses, piers, and shops - was a natural next step. After a while, we had this collection unlike anything we've yet to find elsewhere.<br>Like most things in the OBX, when you find something good, you share it with your neighbors.",
                "The result is a print shop featuring fine art prints, canvas pieces, and frames - available to anyone who loves this beautiful piece of earth! Each piece is designed to bring that sense of calm, wonder, and natural beauty into your home, no matter where you live.",
                "With your help, we can scale our printing capabilities, collaborate with more local makers, and expand our collection of imagery. Your support directly strengthens local partnerships and allows us to continue commissioning new works, sourcing locally, and investing in the community that inspires us.&nbsp;",
                "A portion of every sale goes directly to local organizations focused on preservation, youth programs, and local initiatives that keep our coastal towns thriving. When you back this project, you’re not just buying art for your home. You're helping us uplift local artists and empower community nonprofits - all by carrying a piece of coastal beauty into your everyday life.",
                "Thank you for helping us turn art into impact by bringing home the beauty of the coast.",

Over the years, our cameras have taken us from the historical streets of Singapore to the vast landscapes of Kenya, from intricate Turkish patterns to quiet neighborhood corners. We're not professional photographers, we are simply people who fell in love with seeing, and want to share what we've learned about vision, growth, and the beauty of trusting where your eye leads you.",

We gravitated toward things we couldn't quite explain: the symmetry of building facades in Singapore, the way light hit a landscape at golden hour, murals that stopped us in our tracks, the peaceful contrast of greenery against urban chaos.",
                "Over the years, as we traveled through different countries and seasons of life, we realized our photographs were documenting more than places; they were mapping our own evolution. Each image represents a moment when we listened to our inner voice, trusted what drew our attention, and captured it. Through the lens, we trained our eyes. Through travel, we discovered (and are still discovering) ourselves.",

For over a decade, I have dedicated myself to capturing the human form through my lens, developing a distinctive artistic vision that celebrates the inherent beauty and grace of the feminine form.\r\nI specialize in tasteful nude and semi-nude photography, approaching my craft with profound respect for my subjects and an unwavering commitment to artistic excellence. Through my work, I explore the intersection of vulnerability and strength, shadow and light, creating images that honor the natural elegance of the human body while maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and artistic integrity.\r\nThroughout my ten-year career, I have cultivated a reputation for creating a comfortable, respectful environment that allows my subjects to express their authentic selves. My portfolio reflects a deep appreciation for the subtle nuances of form, composition, and emotion that define exceptional portrait work.\r\nI am driven by an artistic passion that views photography as both craft and calling. I continue to push creative boundaries while honoring the trust placed in me by those who choose to collaborate in my artistic vision. My work stands as a testament to the power of photography to capture not just images, but the essence of human beauty and dignity.\r\nWorking with the beauty of the feminine form is not just my profession—it is my passion, and every photograph I create reflects this deep artistic commitment.",

                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Orizzonti – Sky &amp; Clouds</span> è un progetto fotografico modulare composto da <span class=\"bold\">100 immagini originali</span>, realizzate nel corso di diversi viaggi e attraversamenti geografici. Le fotografie sono scattate prevalentemente da una prospettiva aerea o rivolte verso orizzonti aperti senza confini definiti. Il cielo, le nuvole e le continue variazioni cromatiche dell’atmosfera diventano al tempo stesso <span class=\"bold\">soggetto, linguaggio e spazio narrativo</span>, configurandosi come un atlante visivo che racconta il transito, la sospensione e la dimensione immateriale dell’orizzonte contemporaneo.",
                "Le fotografie non documentano un luogo specifico, ma costruiscono uno spazio mentale e simbolico: un <span class=\"bold\">orizzonte globale</span> che invita lo spettatore a una lettura personale, contemplativa e proiettata nel futuro.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">100 immagini: </span>ogni fotografia è unica e irripetibile, anche nelle loro somiglianze, le foto mostrano sempre variazioni di luce, colore e densità, restituendo l’idea di uno spazio in continuo movimento. L’assenza di riferimenti territoriali espliciti trasforma il cielo in un <span class=\"bold\">luogo universale</span>, capace di superare confini geografici e culturali. Orizzonti in continua trasformazione, cieli, nuvole e tramonti si trasformano liberamente in immagini fluide, eteree, creando un’estetica che passa dal figurativo all’astratto senza dover rispondere a nessuna regola stilistica precisa.",

The images reveal the tension between visibility and neglect — lives lived in plain sight yet pushed to society’s margins. Some moments are candid, some composed, but all seek to confront the viewer with the reality of these experiences without sensationalizing them.",

The photographs explore not only individual struggles but also the systemic forces — economic inequality, social stigma, and gaps in care — that shape these lives. Each image is an invitation to look closer, to confront discomfort, and to reflect on how society enables or ignores these realities and above all, empathy."

During the 1980s and 1990s, Conner led the industry as the dominant standard for 3.5-inch hard drives, helping fuel the global adoption of personal computers. By 1990, Conner Peripherals became the fastest-growing startup in U.S. commercial history, setting benchmarks for performance, reliability, and compact engineering that influenced generations of storage technology.\r\n\r\nToday, Conner is reborn for a new era. Building on decades of innovation, the revitalized Conner brand combines its rich engineering heritage with modern industrial design and integrated artificial intelligence to create a new generation of small, portable digital storage solutions. These products are designed for today’s highly mobile, data-driven world—supporting creators, professionals, and everyday users who demand speed, security, and reliability wherever they go.\r\n\r\nConner’s return is driven by evolution, not nostalgia. By rethinking how personal data is stored, managed, and accessed, Conner is redefining portable storage for the age of mobility and AI.\r\n\r\nIn 2026, Conner proudly reintroduces itself on the global stage at CES in Central Hall, showcasing its latest technologies and signaling the beginning of a bold new chapter—one that carries the spirit of its legacy forward while powering the future of digital storage.",

                "Founded in 2018 in Florida by industrial designer Peter Solomon, Wham Bam was born from decades of hands-on experience in both industrial and desktop 3D printing. Long before affordable desktop machines existed, Peter was actively working in professional print labs, operating high-end industrial systems that cost hundreds of thousands—and in some cases millions—of dollars. That background shaped a clear expectation: printing workflows should feel precise, repeatable, and reliable.",
                "As desktop and prosumer 3D printers became more capable and accessible, a pattern emerged. The machines themselves were improving rapidly—but the workflows around them were still full of friction. Setup took too long. Small mistakes caused wasted time and materials. Simple jobs often felt harder than they needed to be.",
                "Peter began designing upgrades, tools, and process improvements to close that gap—bringing industrial-style confidence and repeatability to desktop machines. At first, these solutions were shared openly through forums, videos, and community discussions.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Then something unexpected happened.</span>",
                "Users started asking him to stop explaining how to build the solutions—and instead, just sell them the product.",
                "That moment marked the beginning of Wham Bam Systems.",
                "From the start, the mission has been clear: make 3D printing easier, more fun, and more productive. Every Wham Bam product exists to remove friction, reduce failure, and give users confidence—so they can spend less time troubleshooting and more time creating.",
                "Today, Wham Bam products are used by hobbyists, engineers, print farms, cosplayers, miniature and RC builders, small businesses, and industrial users around the world. While those users are diverse, the goal remains the same: tools that work reliably, feel intuitive, and elevate the entire printing experience.",
                "Wham Bam designs and develops products in-house and works closely with long-standing engineering and manufacturing partners in Taiwan and South China. This hands-on approach allows tight control over materials, tolerances, tooling, and quality—ensuring products are not just well designed, but well executed.",
                "While Wham Bam has received industry recognition and awards, the real validation comes from the community itself: the messages, reviews, photos, and stories shared by customers who rely on these tools every day.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We stand behind our products because we use them ourselves - daily, in real workflows - just like you will.</span>",

                "An engineer with a background in law, Jeff brings together technical depth, structured thinking, and a relentless drive to improve how things work. He is deeply passionate about 3D printing and making, and has spent years beta testing, advising, and collaborating with Wham Bam Systems and other respected companies in the industry.",
                "Jeff’s approach aligns perfectly with Wham Bam’s mission. He focuses on removing friction, simplifying workflows, and making tools that feel intuitive and repeatable. Through his company, <span class=\"bold\">Psycho3D</span>, Jeff takes bold ideas and pushes them through real-world testing until they become practical, manufacturable, and reliable products.",
                "Jeff doesn’t design in theory - he designs from experience.",
                "The ULTIM8 JIG was born from real-world frustration.",
                "After nearly a year of hands-on testing with the EufyMake E1, Jeff repeatedly encountered the same issues: slow setup, inconsistent alignment, and a lack of repeatability that made even simple jobs take longer than they should.",
                "Instead of accepting those limitations, Jeff began sketching solutions—asking how the experience could be easier, more fun, and more productive without compromising precision.",
                "When Jeff shared the concept with Peter, the alignment was immediate. Together, they refined, engineered, tested, and reworked the system until it met Wham Bam’s standards for durability, precision, and real-world usability.",

The nervous system doesn’t interpret it as real walking in the full neurological sense, because actual walking involves complex motor commands from the brain and active muscle contraction. What we’re doing is different: we mechanically reproduce key elements of the walking cycle that are responsible for supporting circulation. This means we’re targeting the peripheral physiological effects of walking especially the circulatory dynamics rather than trying to replicate the brain’s motor patterns. In short, the goal isn’t to trick the nervous system into believing you’re walking, but to simulate the parts of walking that help keep blood flow active during inactivity."

The goal is to deliver more oxygen to the muscles and help clear metabolic by-products by improving blood flow. That’s why common recovery approaches include light active movement, compression, and other circulation-focused methods. Most solutions in this space focus only on recovery — improving circulation after fatigue has already occurred. Our perspective is different. With the technology we’re developing, we aim to support circulation strongly, but the key point is what happens before fatigue becomes the issue. Even when muscles aren’t tired, inactivity itself slows circulation. We focus on the importance of keeping this system active and supporting it during every period of inactivity."

                        "text": "Hello Chris, I understand your question very well. ARCH is not a medical device. It is prohibited to feature medical devices on Kickstarter. Based on past experiences, getting a clinical study published in a peer reviewed journal often takes 1 2 years. And before that, the same physician must conduct a long term follow up of at least 1 2 years using the same ultrasound with the same focus group (at least 100 people), provided that all devices given to those 100 people are identical. I am pointing this out so you can estimate the 2 4 year delay it would cause both you and us if a clinical study were a requirement. Furthermore, a clinical study is not expected for a wellness device; the necessity for clinical studies applies only to medical devices. Our habit of conducting scientific studies stems entirely from our past experiences and scientific approach. Therefore, we have tests and reports created with a scientific approach within our own organization to find answers to questions such as how it can be better, what the real life impact is of what we propose in theory, and what the results of comparisons with traditional methods are. This is simply a matter of principle and habit. However, besides all this, if you examine recovery systems that have existed for more than 20 years, you can see the traditional methods of what we promise. You can find the opportunity to verify this approach to the muscle pump, which has existed for many years, through these examples."

It is a <span class=\"bold\">Pilot Run</span> to validate the SlicedPrint automation software in a real-world scenario. We are building a specific array of <span class=\"bold\">4 Anycubic Kobra S1 units</span>, modified with our custom \"ACME\" auto-ejection system and connected to our control server.",

By backing this project, you are not buying \"store credit\". You are funding the hardware setup and raw materials for this specific pilot phase. In exchange, you get to be part of the test run: You send us your STLs, and our system manufactures them to prove it works.",

The difference is in how we calculate your results: AirPatch uses a controlled 7-day sampling window with continuous airflow, giving us precise data about your air quality during that period. FilterCut analyzes months of accumulated particles, giving us a longer-term picture—though with slightly more estimation since we're working backward from your filter's history.

                "<span class=\"bold\">Why We’re Raising Funds</span>",
                "Commercial real estate underwriting is still dominated by spreadsheets.",
                "Most investors, brokers, and operators rely on fragile Excel models that are hard to audit, easy to break, and nearly impossible to standardize across deals and teams. Small changes can cause hidden errors. Sharing models creates version chaos. And institutional-level analysis is often locked behind expensive, closed systems.",
                "CRE Valuation Pro was created to solve this problem.",
                "This project began as a practical tool to replace my own spreadsheets with a cleaner, more transparent way to analyze real commercial real estate deals. Over time, it evolved into a web-based platform designed to model cash flow, returns, and valuation scenarios across multiple asset classes in a consistent, repeatable way.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">CRE Valuation Pro is an actively developed platform currently in its final pre-launch phase. The core functionality is in place and usable today, and this campaign is designed to support a strong and well-executed public launch.</span>",
                "We’re raising funds to take CRE Valuation Pro from a working product into a more complete, stable, and accessible platform for the broader commercial real estate community.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What We’re Building</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">CRE Valuation Pro is a cloud-based underwriting and valuation platform for commercial real estate that is preparing for its full public launch.</span>",
                "It is designed to help users:",
                "Analyze income-producing properties using clear, structured assumptions",
                "Model cash flow, financing, and exit scenarios",
                "Evaluate deals across common asset classes such as multifamily, office, retail, industrial, hospitality, and specialty assets",
                "Replace spreadsheet-based workflows with a centralized, auditable system",
                "This is not an investment fund, advisory service, or promise of financial outcomes. It is a software tool that helps users organize, analyze, and understand deal assumptions more clearly.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">What the $20,000 Will Be Used For</span>",
                "The funds raised through this Kickstarter will be used to support <span class=\"bold\">final launch preparation and platform refinement</span>.",
                "Specifically, the budget will be allocated toward:",

                "The funding goal is intentionally modest. It reflects what is realistically needed to complete these improvements and support the platform’s public launch.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Why This Matters to Me</span>",
                "I care about this project because I’ve lived the problem.",
                "Commercial real estate analysis is too important to be left to broken formulas, hidden cells, and outdated templates. Good underwriting should be transparent, repeatable, and easy to understand — whether you’re reviewing your own deal or sharing it with partners.",
                "CRE Valuation Pro is about raising the baseline for how deals are evaluated, without requiring institutional budgets or closed systems. This project exists to make professional-grade analysis more accessible and more honest.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">How We Plan to Make It Happen</span>",

                "<span class=\"bold\">Not all backers are expected to be users of the platform; some may simply wish to support the project and its goals.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Thank You</span>",
                "Backing this project means supporting a practical tool for commercial real estate analysis and helping move the industry away from fragile, spreadsheet-driven workflows.",

                "We are a small, international team of engineers, designers, and pilots united by a single goal — to make vertical flight simpler, faster, and more efficient.<br>Our group has already built and tested multiple drone prototypes, working together with partners in <span class=\"bold\">Germany, Lithuania, USA, Ukaraine, Poland and one person from Canada</span>.<br>We’ve spent the past few years developing components such as <span class=\"bold\">transmissions, swashplates, control systems, and lightweight airframes</span>, all leading to the creation of the <span class=\"bold\">SM-300 Cargo VTOL</span> — our most advanced model yet.",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">SM-300</span> is a hybrid <span class=\"bold\">vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) cargo drone</span> capable of carrying up to <span class=\"bold\">150 kg of payload</span> and flying at speeds of up to <span class=\"bold\">400 km/h</span> with endurance of up to <span class=\"bold\">5 hours</span>.<br>It combines the versatility of a helicopter with the efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft, opening new possibilities for <span class=\"bold\">logistics, rescue operations, and autonomous missions</span>.",
                "Our prototype — the one you see on this page — is <span class=\"bold\">real and operational</span>, already assembled and currently undergoing system integration tests.<br>With your support, we plan to complete the <span class=\"bold\">final stage of testing and first full-scale flight</span>.",
                "The Flight Project started with a simple but bold idea — to rethink how vertical flight can be achieved efficiently.<br>In <span class=\"bold\">2021</span>, we built our first prototype — a <span class=\"bold\">twin-rotor drone based on the Chinook helicopter principle</span>. It was our first step toward understanding the balance between lifting power and mechanical efficiency.",
                "During <span class=\"bold\">2022–2023</span>, we met with potential customers and aviation partners to better understand their real-world needs.<br>It became clear that the market doesn’t just need a heavy-lift drone — it needs an aircraft with <span class=\"bold\">low operating costs</span>, <span class=\"bold\">long endurance</span>, and <span class=\"bold\">higher speed</span> than traditional helicopters.",
                "This insight led us to a completely new approach:<br>We moved from a twin-rotor concept to a <span class=\"bold\">convertible VTOL design with a rotating fuselage</span>, capable of both vertical lift and efficient horizontal flight.<br>To achieve this, we developed:",
                "These innovations form the foundation of the <span class=\"bold\">SM-300 Cargo VTOL</span>, a next-generation hybrid aircraft designed to perform real missions in the near future — not as a concept, but as a working machine.",
                "The SM-300 prototype is now ~<span class=\"bold\">90% ready for flight</span>, and this campaign will help us <span class=\"bold\">launch and document its first full-scale test flights.</span>",
                "One of the key goals of the SM-300 Cargo VTOL is to <span class=\"bold\">significantly reduce CO₂ emissions</span> compared to conventional helicopters used for cargo transport and logistics.<br>By combining vertical takeoff capability with fixed-wing aerodynamic efficiency, the SM-300 consumes less fuel and can perform missions at a fraction of the operating cost.",
                "By using a lightweight airframe, optimized aerodynamics, and high-efficiency engines, the SM-300 can achieve <span class=\"bold\">up to 70% lower CO₂ emissions</span> compared to light and medium helicopters performing similar missions.",
                "In practical terms, that means lower fuel costs, lower noise, and a real contribution to cleaner skies — all while maintaining speed and mission flexibility.",
                "We are now entering the final and most critical phase of the Flight Project — preparing the SM-300 Cargo VTOL for its first series of integrated tests and flight demonstrations.<br>All major assemblies are complete, and 2025–2026 will be dedicated to systems integration, ground testing, and full flight validation.",

                "Each milestone will be documented and shared through exclusive backer updates, photos, and videos.<br>When the SM-300 lifts off, every name and message on the drone will literally take flight with us.",
                "Every euro raised through Kickstarter will go directly toward completing and testing the SM-300 Cargo VTOL prototype.<br>Our team already built the full-scale aircraft and covered the majority of its production costs internally.<br>Now, your support will help us finish the final stage — turning a completed prototype into a flying, proven machine.",
                "Here’s how the funds will be used:",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">We’ve already covered more than 70% of the total development costs ourselves.</span>",
                "Every expense directly supports testing and validation.<br>We’re using our existing facilities, in-house fabrication tools, and university partnerships to minimize costs and maximize real progress.<br>Backers will receive detailed updates with photos and videos from each phase, showing exactly where the support goes.",
                "The SM-300 Cargo VTOL has a total surface area of <span class=\"bold\">13.2 square meters</span>, including its active winglets.<br>We’re inviting you to become part of that surface — to <span class=\"bold\">help lift our dream into the sky</span>.",
                "We’re offering <span class=\"bold\">10 square meters of the drone’s surface</span> to our supporters — every message, every logo, every name that will fly with us represents a piece of that shared vision.",
                "Our team is self-funding the entire development — from materials to testing — but in every project like this, <span class=\"bold\">funding is the lifeblood</span>.<br>Your support will help us move faster, reduce delays, and complete the first flight of a real, working machine that was built from passion and persistence."

                "Imagine you're a first-time hunter stepping into the wild for the very first time. The excitement is there, but so is the uncertainty—where do you even start? Or maybe you're an experienced hunter exploring a new area, like moving from the flatlands to Montana's rugged mountains, and you have no local knowledge to rely on. Worse yet, life gets in the way: work, family, or just the short off-season window means you don't have weeks to scout terrain, track patterns, or wait out weather changes.",
                "Traditional hunting relies on trial and error, gut instinct, and time-intensive prep. For many, this leads to frustrating blank days, wasted trips, and missed opportunities. In a world where outdoor adventures should be rewarding and sustainable, these barriers keep too many people from enjoying the thrill of the hunt responsibly.",
                "That's where TrackiTmaps comes in. We're building an innovative mobile app that uses advanced AI to predict optimal hunting locations for specific animals, analyzing real-time factors like geographical location, elevation, time of day, current and upcoming weather, season, typical animal behavior, rutting status, human pressure, and population density. No more guesswork—TrackiTmaps identifies primary and secondary spots, giving you precise, data-driven insights to enhance your experience.",
                "Whether you're a newbie learning the ropes, scouting unfamiliar land, or squeezing in a quick hunt between commitments, TrackiTmaps empowers you to hunt smarter. It's not about replacing your skills; it's about amplifying them with technology, so you spend less time searching and more time connecting with nature.",
                "Key Features:",
                "We've already built high-fidelity prototypes and are nearing beta with our dev team. Your support will polish the app, expand AI datasets, and launch it to hunters everywhere. Join us in making hunting more inclusive and efficient!",
                "TrackiTmaps uses AI technology to predict optimal hunting locations, and we're committed to transparency per Kickstarter's guidelines.",
                "We're aiming for $16,792 to bring TrackiTmaps to life. This includes built-in buffers for Kickstarter's 5% fee and payment processing 5%, netting us about $15,000. Here's the realistic breakdown:",
                "If we overfund, stretch goals include new features like AR overlays or community forums. Every dollar counts—thanks for helping us hit the trail!",
                "Hi, I'm Aaron B. from Missoula, Montana—a dedicated family man, passionate hunter, and seasoned designer who's spent years exploring the backcountry. My family is everything to me; they inspire my drive to create tools that make outdoor adventures more accessible, allowing more time for what truly matters—sharing those experiences with loved ones. Frustrated by the barriers facing new hunters, those in unfamiliar terrain, or anyone juggling busy schedules, I dreamed up TrackiTmaps to blend cutting-edge tech with the timeless tradition of hunting.",
                "With over 14 years in design, I've built verticals from the ground up (0-1), leading teams to launch innovative products that solve real-world problems. My huge passion for hunting—whether tracking elk in the Bitterroot Valley or teaching my kids about wildlife—fuels this project. TrackiTmaps bridges the gap between my design expertise and outdoor love, using AI to predict prime spots and streamline scouting, so hunters like us can focus on the thrill rather than the hassle. With a solid background in outdoor adventures and a dedicated dev team, we're turning this vision into reality. Follow me on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/aaronbrown316) for updates, behind-the-scenes insights, and hunting stories!"
