And language is magical – it’s how humans explain and describe their world, it’s how we communicate with each other and the gods, it’s how we give shape to our experiences. The runes, like the letters, symbols, and words of many pre-Christian languages, hold within them the memory, inspiration, and wisdom of the Ancestors.",

These photos of completed projects are shown to give backers an idea of the kind of work their pledges will fund.</span>",
                "In the tempestuous early days of 2025, I made three original paper theatre scenes to carry some of my strongest feelings about the power of ordinary people to rescue what we love and to resist authoritarianism. Two of those pieces—\"Keep A Light On\" and \"Ice Won't Win\"—are shown in the featured image in the banner for this campaign.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">In 2026, I want to make <span class=\"bold\">more pieces</span> in this same spirit and exhibit them together as a set. The number I'm able to make will be determined by the success of this campaign. I'll proceed even if I can only make one, but it is my hope that this Kickstarter will be able to fund the creation of at least three entirely new pieces.</span> <span class=\"text-italic\">See the \"Funding Structure and Stretch Goals\" section for more information about this.</span>",
                "In addition to the original pieces I'm hoping to create, I plan to scan each separate layer of these paper theatres and thread them together digitally to fashion a flat image version that can be sent digitally to backers at the \"Digital Print Supporter\" tier, and can be professionally-printed and mailed to backers at the \"Fine Art Print Supporter\" tier and above. This is a time-consuming process I couldn't afford to tackle with my previous paper theatres, but upfront funding can make it a possibility now.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Form</span><br>The tunnel books I created in 2025 were some of the most precious things I brought with me out of a very difficult year. In each place I have displayed them (both online and at in-person events) they have elicited strong and sometimes emotional reactions. For me, they have been <span class=\"bold\">what art can be at its very best: a vehicle that facilitates connection between human souls</span>. During a disheartening era where AI-generated material is poisoning people's ability to trust and enjoy art, these clearly-analog pieces responding to the current moment have been one of the primary things keeping me excited about creating. I want to do more work in this form because I believe it engages audiences effectively and encourages other to participate in creative work.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Content&nbsp;</span><br>In our time, values that once felt too elementary to make a hullabaloo about seem suddenly to be in dire need of a spirited defense. Similarly, coarse, mean-spirited attitudes that were once dismissed as cringe and fringe are being lauded in high places. I believe it is of urgent importance that Ordinary People push back against these trends and reaffirm in every way we know how that we have no intention of abandoning the core ethical principles that undergird a civil society: honest dealings, generosity of heart, support for humanitarian institutions, a spirit of welcome towards people fleeing violence, an ethic rooted in sharing rather than in hoarding, a determination to tackle problems collaboratively, and an avoidance of competitive bluster towards neighbors and allies.",
                "While I regularly donate to causes I believe in and participate in protests and visibility events, the arts always feel like my truest form of expression, and<span class=\"bold\"> I want to do more creative work that responds to our times with imagery that is also timeless</span>. &nbsp;",
                "\"No one is coming to save us\" people were saying in the dark days of early 2025 when the current U.S. administration took sudden aim at global alliances, refugee communities, crucial life-saving aid funding, public lands, free speech, democracy, the concept of empathy, and truth itself in a cascade of aggressive actions.&nbsp;<br><br>And I thought, without knowing whether it would prove true, <span class=\"bold\">\"We. We are coming to save us.\"</span>",
                "It's 2026 now. Our democracy is still under assault and we have been living through the nightmare of an active constitutional crisis for well over a year. But in the midst of all this, someone has been coming through and it's no one you've heard of. It's not a film star or a CEO or a senate minority leader. It's just this: ordinary people.",
                "All year long, ordinary people have been showing up to show care and support for their struggling communities and imperiled neighbors.",
                "Showing up to show a spirit of resistance towards the hardhearted cruelty and rampant lawlessness presently on display in the halls of power.",
                "Showing that rescue and resistance are often two sides of the very same coin.",
                "Ordinary people have been organizing food drives, fundraisers, and charity auctions to counter the worst affects of irresponsible funding cuts. Ordinary people have been giving up their time off to flock to protests by the millions. Ordinary people have stood outdoors in blowing snow and blazing heat to hold signs demanding moral courage from elected leaders. Ordinary people have been speaking up in public forums fully aware that using their voices may cost them friendships and business opportunities. Ordinary people have poured countless hours into vetting information in a disinformation hellscape, curating resources for their communities, and expressing resistance in poetry, painting, and song.",
                "We may feel small in the scheme of things, but there are so, so many of us. When each of us is doing the thing we know how to do, Ordinary People are a force that won't be easily stopped.",
                "These \"tunnel book\" paper theatre scenes are complex and extremely time-consuming to design and create. It typically takes me a full work week to make one, and handmade pieces that require this level of time and attention seldom sell for anything close to a living wage. Tackling this kind of project is thus a major financial commitment, and it keeps me away from work that can more reliably pay my bills. I've been dreaming about expanding this paper theatre series for over six months now, but have been kept away from it for financial reasons. Getting some upfront funding for this series via Kickstarter will allow me to take the necessary time away from gig work to make what is on my soul while the time is right.<br><br>Of course, depending on which support tier backers gravitate towards, the majority of the funds raised in this campaign will likely go directly towards printing, packaging, and shipping the little art prints that capture the new paper theatre scene(s) I create.",

                "Sarajevo, between the 50s and the end of the 20th century, had a central place in the artistic and cultural scene of the Balkans. A city that promoted the creation of art, where artist were close to their public, their work accessible and important to society, cultural centres were thriving, concerts, exhibitions and plays were the constantly happening, and visited in high numbers. Following the war of 1992, Sarajevo struggled to rebuild this cultural fervour, artists were no longer receiving the means to create and promote their work, places that were once dedicated to that effort, mostly public establishments, were either given new functions or left to abandonment.&nbsp;",
                "Today, Sarajevo is a city where culture and art clearly still hold the same importance it once did, but most artists eventually bump into the wall that is the lack of a space to show their work, to make it exist in society. It is now difficult for artists, particularly young emerging artists, to get the exposure and remuneration they need, not only making a career in art very difficult, which in turn makes their work difficult for the public to access and appreciate their work.&nbsp;",
                "The spirit and potential that fuelled the once thriving cultural and artistic scene of Sarajevo is still there, it however suffers from a lack of support and opportunities to express itself, the same can be said for the whole region.",
                "I am Sasha Mingasson, one of the young aforementioned emerging artists, during a brief period in the academy of fine arts of Sarajevo, I have met many young talented artists, full of ambitions, ideas and most importantly, with the will to contribute to the reconstruction of the local artistic scene. What they are lacking the most, is an outlet and the finances (or a prospect of remuneration), without which no artistic project can come to realisation, nor is a career in art feasible. It is because of this lack of prospect that lots of people with a passion and talent for art end up looking for a career elsewhere, which often, leads to a great and dangerous loss of authentic regional culture and art.&nbsp;",
                "It isn't for a lack of interest in art, because of an apathy and disinterest in culture that the situation is as it is, the few cultural events that do take place, such as the SFF (Sarajevo film festival), Jazz Fest, or exhibitions in the national gallery, are all visited in high numbers and are something that locals are proud of. These are things that are highly sought after, the only problem is the lack of funding, initiatives and spaces dedicated to art.&nbsp;",
                "In this in response to these difficulties, with the ambition to give these young emerging artists a voice and a presence in society, that i am opening Mezzanine. A space for this generation of artists to express themselves, to give them the public they need.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;Mezzanine is a multi-functional space, it will be a gallery that also functions as a print shop, with a small screen printing studio on the floor. Every month a different artist will use the exhibition space to exhibit his works, as of right now there are three artists in line, Ryan O'Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) and Tristan Berthoud (@Obscutrist). That space will also be used to display a catalogue of prints (mostly screen printed and giclee prints) from young artists of the region as well as to exhibit some of my works.&nbsp;",
                "The silk-screen printing studio will allow “Mezzanine” to have its own in-house production of screen printed prints, and give those artists the opportunity to print series of their works. It will also be used to print on hoodies and shirts, creating a collection of clothes with artworks by young local artists, not only turning their art into something wearable, but is also one of the best ways to get their works to be seen and talked about.",
                "The studio will also function as the economical backbone of the gallery, by offering screen printing services to businesses, a sort of an financial safety net.",
                "To make this project a reality, i need your help shouldering the initial costs. To give a second life to the space, and to acquire the material to set the studio up.&nbsp;",
                "The funds would go in the following :&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">all available works for postcards and prints will be communicated to backers at the end of the campaign. &nbsp;They will either be works of Sasha Mingasson or Tristan Berthoud, the choice is yours to make.&nbsp;</span>",
                "Sarajevo, entre les années 50 et la fin du XXe siècle, occupait une place centrale sur la scène artistique et culturelle des Balkans. C’était une ville qui encourageait la création artistique, où les artistes étaient proches de leur public, où leurs œuvres étaient accessibles et jouaient un rôle important dans la société. Les centres culturels étaient florissants ; concerts, expositions et pièces de théâtre se succédaient en permanence et attiraient un large public.&nbsp;",
                "À la suite de la guerre de 1992, Sarajevo a eu du mal à retrouver cet élan culturel. Les artistes ne disposaient plus des moyens nécessaires pour créer et promouvoir leur travail, et les lieux autrefois dédiés à cette mission — principalement des établissements publics — ont été réaffectés à d’autres usages ou laissés à l’abandon.&nbsp;",
                "Aujourd’hui, Sarajevo est une ville où la culture et l’art ont clairement conservé l’importance qu’ils avaient autrefois. Pourtant, la plupart des artistes finissent par se heurter à un obstacle majeur : le manque d’espaces pour exposer leur travail, pour leur permettre d’exister au sein de la société. Il est désormais difficile pour les artistes, en particulier les jeunes artistes émergents, d’obtenir la visibilité et la rémunération dont ils ont besoin. Cela rend non seulement une carrière artistique difficilement réalisable, mais limite également l’accès du public à leurs œuvres et sa capacité à les apprécier. L’esprit et le potentiel qui ont nourri la scène culturelle et artistique autrefois florissante de Sarajevo sont toujours présents.",
                "&nbsp;Cependant, ils souffrent d’un manque de soutien et d’opportunités pour s’exprimer. Cette ville, tout comme la région entière, a besoin de d'avantage de lieux pour exprimer et montrer son identité artistique, son âme. C’est un territoire riche de jeunes talents motivés qui restent invisibles. Dans ce contexte, chaque effort en faveur de la promotion de la culture et de l’art est essentiel. Je suis convaincue qu’avec un léger coup de pouce, ces jeunes artistes peuvent à nouveau occuper une place centrale dans la société d’aujourd’hui. Je souhaite y contribuer à mon échelle, en apportant ma propre pierre à l’édifice sous la forme d'une gallerie consacré à la promotion des jeunes artistes locaux émergents : <span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span>.",
                "Je m’appelle Sasha Mingasson, et je fais partie de ces jeunes artistes émergents mentionnés plus haut. Durant une brève période passée à l’Académie des Beaux-Arts de Sarajevo, j’ai rencontré de nombreux jeunes artistes talentueux, pleins d’ambition et d’idées, et surtout animés par la volonté de participer à la reconstruction de la scène artistique locale. Ce qui leur manque le plus, c’est un espace d’expression et des moyens financiers (ou une perspective de rémunération), sans lesquels aucun projet artistique ne peut voir le jour, et aucune carrière artistique n’est viable. C’est précisément faute de perspectives que de nombreuses personnes passionnées et talentueuses finissent par s’orienter vers d’autres carrières, ce qui conduit trop souvent à des œuvres et des artistes potentiels qui ne verront jamais le jour.",
                "&nbsp;La situation actuelle n’est pas due à un manque d’intérêt pour l’art, ni à une apathie ou un désintérêt pour la culture. Les rares événements culturels existants — tels que le SFF (Sarajevo Film Festival), le Jazz Fest ou les expositions à la Galerie nationale — attirent un public nombreux et constituent une véritable fierté locale. Ces événements sont très attendus ; le problème réside dans le manque de financements, d’initiatives et d’espaces dédiés à l’art.",
                "C'est en réponse à ces difficultés, avec l'ambition de donner à ces jeunes artistes émergents une voix et une présence dans la société, que j'ouvre Mezzanine. Un espace où cette jeune génération d'artistes pourra s'exprimer, et qui pourra leur donner une audience.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span> sera un espace multifonctionnel : une galerie qui fera également office de boutique de tirages (reproductions/prints), avec un petit atelier de sérigraphie intégré. Chaque mois, un artiste différent utilisera l’espace d’exposition pour présenter ses œuvres. À ce jour, trois artistes sont déjà prévus : Ryan O’Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) et Tristan Berthoud. Cet espace servira également à présenter un catalogue d’estampes (principalement des sérigraphies et des impressions giclée) réalisées par de jeunes artistes de la région, ainsi que certaines de mes propres œuvres.",
                "&nbsp;L’atelier de sérigraphie permettra à Mezzanine d’assurer une production interne de tirages en sérigraphie et d’offrir aux artistes la possibilité d’imprimer des séries de leurs œuvres. Il servira également à imprimer sur des sweats à capuche et des t-shirts, afin de créer une collection de vêtements ornés d’œuvres de jeunes artistes locaux. Cela permettra non seulement de rendre leur art portable, mais aussi d’en favoriser la diffusion et la visibilité. L’atelier constituera également l’ossature économique de la galerie, en proposant des services de sérigraphie aux entreprises — une sorte de filet de sécurité financier.",
                "Pour concrétiser ce projet, j’ai besoin de votre soutien afin de couvrir les coûts initiaux. Il s’agit de redonner vie à l’espace et d’acquérir le matériel nécessaire à l’installation de l’atelier.",

Our team brings over two decades of experience in developing practical modeling solutions for hobbyists, built on the shared knowledge of modelers across many genres and from all around the world.",
                "A little over a year ago, we introduced <span class=\"bold\">Ionic Smart Colors</span>, a new line created to support wargamers, tabletop gamers, and figure painters with that same experience and a shared passion. Thanks to your support, this new line, representing a new space for us, has continued to grow and evolve. We are truly grateful to the community for welcoming Ionic Smart Colors so warmly.",
                "Your feedback has always guided our work, and we’ve always listened. After many requests for more metallic colors, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to Ionic: the <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal</span> range...",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal </span>has been designed to provide hobbyists with all the metallics they could need for any project, from the classic silvers and golds, to metallics reds, blues, and more, with the same strengths and quality they are used to from Ionic. Featuring <span class=\"bold\">60 new</span> water-based acrylic paints in total, each color is manufactured with intense metallic pigments.&nbsp;",
                "<br>Each color is part of a set which provides an <span class=\"bold\">easy-to-use 3-Step Smart System</span> for painting true metallic metals consisting of a <span class=\"bold\">base, metallic wash, and highlight</span>. This system can be applied in order:<span class=\"bold\"> base &gt; metallic wash &gt; highlight</span> or varied based on personal preference, such as <span class=\"bold\">base &gt; highlight &gt; metallic wash</span>.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks to its simplicity, this system can be used by painters of <span class=\"bold\">any experience level</span>, whether you are a beginner painting your first army, or an experienced painter applying the metallic tones to your latest display piece. Real Heavy Metal is <span class=\"bold\">versatile </span>and can adapt to <span class=\"bold\">any technique</span> or method of application, be it brush, airbrush, drybrush, glazing, layering and more....&nbsp;",
                "The process of basecoat, wash, and highlight is a common methodology in any modeler's arsenal. However, because washes are typically matte, they can dull metallic finishes. Even glossy washes that preserve shine often reduce the metallic character of the pigments.",
                "Real Heavy Metal uses <span class=\"bold\">Metallic Washes</span> made from darkened versions of the same metallic pigments found in the base and highlight colors, helping <span class=\"bold\">preserve the metallic sheen</span> of your paintwork throughout the entire process. Painting True Metallic Metals has never been more metal!&nbsp;",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal Metallic Washes </span>are also highlighy pigmented. When used over metallics, this preserves the saturation and sheen of the metallic base color. However, when applied over a light color, such as white, they create shading and highlights with a single bushstroke. As you can see on the below example:",

After four years of development, it was incredibly rewarding to see how warmly the community received the Ionic formulation. At the same time, we heard a great deal of feedback that the range needed more metallic tones.",
                "With that in mind, we’ve spent the past year developing <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal</span>, and it’s now ready for release. We chose Kickstarter for this launch because it allows us to ensure hobbyists around the world receive their paints at the same time, while also giving us the opportunity to offer a special discount. We believe this is the fairest way to say thank you for the loyalty and support that has helped shape and grow Ionic. It also allows us to gauge demand so that <span class=\"bold\">no body is left waiting</span> for a second production run.",
                "Shipping costs will be collected <span class=\"bold\">after</span> the Kickstarter campaign ends. Once the campaign has concluded, we will contact all backers with a code for the pledge manager on our webstore. At that point, you will be able to select the specific sets and add-ons you would like. The webstore will calculate shipping options and costs based on the total weight and size of your pledge.

                "The dream to become a small production potter is something I have possessed since high school. After acquiring my Fine Arts degree from Siena Heights University, I spent a decade without ceramics in my life at all. I never lost hope for my dream, and pressed on through jobs that weren’t my calling. A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to work as a studio assistant for Grayling Ceramics, owned by Shay and Maura Church. Grayling also got its start with the help of Kickstarter. Shay and Maura have provided me with the chance to hone my skills, and learn a great deal about how a small business operates. Harper Homestead Pottery will feature hand made wheel thrown ware that focuses on both function and details influenced by the natural world. While my business will be starting in my home, I do have a future goal to open a brick and mortar studio once I’ve grown the business. If my funds goal can be reached, I will finish out my basement studio, launch my website and business, and begin producing ware on a regular basis. I plan on continuing with my career at Grayling for now, until my business grows enough for me to go out on my own. I am excited to share my creative works with the world!&nbsp;"

                "Tarot cards have been used for eons to provide clarity around what feels overwhelmingly confusing, to confirm those little niggling feelings you have in your gut and can't quite place, or to provide a comforting cosmic squeeze to assure you that you are not alone.",
                "When you are standing at the threshold of your destiny, the cards can show you how to cross it.",
                "They are the Cosmic Translator - giving you the language to explain the feelings, fragmented thoughts, or physical sensations you experience when you are channeling divine guidance.",
                "And the symbols, artwork, colors, and composition of each card is what makes the language clear and concise.",
                "It is crucial to use a deck that you connect with visually, because that is what will make your messages come through, crystal clear.",
                "And that is why the Crystal Doorway Tarot was created.",
                "I wanted to reimagine the classic symbolism of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck in a way that will draw you in with its beauty and give you so many ways to clearly interpret what your intuition is trying to say.",
                "The digital collage art form allowed me to intuitively choose and layer exactly the right images to convey the traditional meanings of each card. And within those images, there are always going to be hidden details that reveal themselves only when necessary, allowing you to have a truly unique reading experience every single time.",
                "This deck consists of 78 full-color cards, with gold gilded edges.",
                "The card back design is unique for a tarot deck - the image is NOT the same whether the cards are upright or reversed! Honestly, I personally don't read reversals, so it didn't feel important to create the backs in a more traditional style.&nbsp;",
                "You will have the full Major Arcana and the four suits - Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles.",
                "There will also be a guidebook to inspire your intuition, not to lead it. Through more of a story-telling style you will be given a little insight to the meanings of each card but I always encourage you to listen to your own intuition before leaning on the guidebook for the answers!",
                "It is also important for me to say that this is not just another deck of pretty images.&nbsp;",
                "You will feel the emotions of the people and animals depicted on each card, through their facial expressions or body language. Your eyes will be drawn to the light flares and the colors and the tiniest details. And you will see images or symbols synchronized across various cards.",
                "All of these components were intentionally crafted to give you endless layers to peel back. Endless ways to interpret a card or combination of cards based on the context of the reading you are doing.&nbsp;",
                "This deck was created so that you can learn to trust your intuitive nudges based on the emotional hits you get when you see each card. To teach you how to translate the story that is trying to be told.",
                "This is the perfect deck for beginners and seasoned readers alike, and EVERYONE will see something different when they are pulling their cards. That is the magick of this deck.&nbsp;",
                "The Crystal Doorway is open - are you going to step through and see what clarity you find on the other side?"

                "Long before the first empires carved their borders and before written history claimed authority over truth, there existed a civilization now known only through fractured legend — the Atlantean Ascendants. They did not conquer through armies or engines. They shaped existence through symbols, resonance, and an understanding of reality that modern minds would struggle to grasp. Their cities were instruments of power. White stone temples aligned to the heavens, corridors etched with sigils that hummed softly when walked upon, pillars that acted as anchors against forces unseen. Geometry was not decoration — it was technology. Language was not merely spoken — it was encoded into matter itself. Through these methods, they learned to stabilize energies that lay just beyond ordinary perception, energies ancient even then. For a time, their mastery seemed absolute. Their world prospered in a quiet brilliance that bordered on the sacred. Yet the deeper they looked into the fabric of existence, the more they began to sense that something vast was looking back. And still… they continued.",
                "Their greatest endeavor was not born of war or fear, but of ambition — a longing to transcend the fragile limits of mortality. From decades of research into alchemy, cosmic resonance, and sigil harmonics came the creation of the Crimson Elixir: a living medium said to bridge flesh and eternity. It shimmered with a beauty that unsettled even its creators, like liquid starlight laced with something darker. The Ascendants believed it could heal divine wounds, expand consciousness, and allow a chosen vessel to step beyond humanity without losing it. Mirelle was chosen. Brilliant. Attuned. Revered by many, quietly feared by others. Whether she volunteered out of hope, duty, or something more private remains debated in the fragments of surviving lore. What is known is that she entered the Inner Sanctum willingly — the most sacred convergence point of Atlantean architecture — where the final ascension ritual began. For a moment, everything aligned perfectly. Then reality began to resist.",
                "Witness accounts, though incomplete, describe a sudden stillness before the collapse — as if the world itself held its breath. No one knows why the sigils that had stabilized Atlantis for generations faltered. Energy surged without harmony. Structures meant to anchor dimensional forces began to fracture from within. The Inner Sanctum sealed itself instinctively, an automatic defense mechanism activated by forces far older than the <span class=\"bold\">Ascendants</span>. Entire districts vanished without a sound. Guardians awakened, not to protect the people, but to contain what had been unleashed. Mirelle did not die. But neither did she remain wholly human. The Crimson Elixir fused with her in a way no one had predicted, binding her to something vast, patient, and profoundly alien. She became a living anomaly — a nexus where reality bends, memory distorts, and time seems uncertain. Atlantis fell from history soon after. Survivors scattered. Records faded. Myths replaced memory. Yet the Sanctum never truly slept. It waited. And now, the seals are weakening after thousands of years - waiting for the right people to reactivate them.",
                "The Inner Sanctum is only the beginning. Future arcs will explore: Other Atlantean ruins, Hidden factions and guardians, The deeper truth behind the Crimson Elixir And what Mirelle’s awakening truly means for the world. Some answers may illuminate. Others may raise questions far more unsettling.",

                "I am raising funds for the purpose of skill sharing and cross cultural bridge building. I want to give away art materials to local Thai people and teach them how to use the materials for free. Ultimately, I want to promote a different kind of tourism by creating a Mecca for artists, which attracts artists from all over the world. I want to help the best practitioners from amongst my students to use their new skills to create fabulous art with a local theme and to teach others by putting on their own workshops. My name is Philip Potter. I am an artist. I am a teacher. I am a writer. And I have severe ET, a neurological disability similar to Parkinson’s disease. So, if I can do it, anyone can.&nbsp;<br><br>The starting point is the island of Phuket, Thailand. I have been offered a venue there to put on workshops and start an art club. I am hopeful that the project will become self-sustaining in approximately 12 months. To pay for the venue, I will teach art classes to the kindergarten pupils at my friend’s school as a way to pay her back for allowing me to use the school after the pupils have gone home. I intend to run art classes for the growing expatriate community - Thailand has been very proactive in making a welcoming environment for retired western people with easy access to long term visas etc. and an art class is a good way to meet new people and reduce isolation. I will also offer art workshops to visiting tourists who come from all over the world - people who want to experience something new. Once developed, these potential income streams will allow me to offer free art materials and art classes to local Thai people, building a bridge between all three communities. I intend to do this using Claude Monet landscapes aka Monet Magic. There is a strong historical connection between French Impressionism and Thailand, which became popular there in the mid twentieth century.&nbsp;",
                "The Monet Magic idea was developed while teaching in Indonesia - I needed a method that produced quick wins as well as a lasting sense of achievement. This technique works in all areas, from private one-to-one lessons to corporate well-being workshops. It turns ‘can’t do’ staff into ‘can do’ staff and it tackles the reluctant artist’s fear of facing a blank piece of paper. Any problem can be solved with the right approach, the right tools and the right techniques. I can teach anyone to replicate a Monet landscape in 2-3 hours using a step-by-step mixed media approach. The resulting paintings leave the participants both amazed and excited over what they have achieved.&nbsp;<br><br>Being able to visually interpret the world around you and the world inside you is a ticket to better mental health and well-being as well as a saleable skill. Using your brain in a variety of ways can help in every area of life, leading to higher level thinking and more robust levels of concentration. This technique releases gamma waves in the brain in the same way solving a complex maths problem leads to a eureka moment - but without the maths. Monet is just the vehicle for the technique - once you have mastered the process you will be ready to create your own masterpieces quickly and confidently.&nbsp;",
                "In a class, everyone paints the same picture. You will be taken through a step-by-step process. Everything is explained and demonstrated, so whether you learn better visually or through instruction your needs are catered for and as I show you what to do there is no language barrier. The painting is broken down into its constituent elements and rebuilt from the ground up. The class ends when the participant’s painting looks as near as possible a twin to the original. The process takes approximately 3 hours. It works like magic.",
