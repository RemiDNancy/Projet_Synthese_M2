And language is magical – it’s how humans explain and describe their world, it’s how we communicate with each other and the gods, it’s how we give shape to our experiences. The runes, like the letters, symbols, and words of many pre-Christian languages, hold within them the memory, inspiration, and wisdom of the Ancestors.",

                "In the tempestuous early days of 2025, I made three original paper theatre scenes to carry some of my strongest feelings about the power of ordinary people to rescue what we love and to resist authoritarianism. Two of those pieces—\"Keep A Light On\" and \"Ice Won't Win\"—are shown in the featured image in the banner for this campaign.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">In 2026, I want to make <span class=\"bold\">more pieces</span> in this same spirit and exhibit them together as a set. The number I'm able to make will be determined by the success of this campaign. I'll proceed even if I can only make one, but it is my hope that this Kickstarter will be able to fund the creation of at least three entirely new pieces.</span> <span class=\"text-italic\">See the \"Funding Structure and Stretch Goals\" section for more information about this.</span>",
                "In addition to the original pieces I'm hoping to create, I plan to scan each separate layer of these paper theatres and thread them together digitally to fashion a flat image version that can be sent digitally to backers at the \"Digital Print Supporter\" tier, and can be professionally-printed and mailed to backers at the \"Fine Art Print Supporter\" tier and above. This is a time-consuming process I couldn't afford to tackle with my previous paper theatres, but upfront funding can make it a possibility now.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Form</span><br>The tunnel books I created in 2025 were some of the most precious things I brought with me out of a very difficult year. In each place I have displayed them (both online and at in-person events) they have elicited strong and sometimes emotional reactions. For me, they have been <span class=\"bold\">what art can be at its very best: a vehicle that facilitates connection between human souls</span>. During a disheartening era where AI-generated material is poisoning people's ability to trust and enjoy art, these clearly-analog pieces responding to the current moment have been one of the primary things keeping me excited about creating. I want to do more work in this form because I believe it engages audiences effectively and encourages other to participate in creative work.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">The Content&nbsp;</span><br>In our time, values that once felt too elementary to make a hullabaloo about seem suddenly to be in dire need of a spirited defense. Similarly, coarse, mean-spirited attitudes that were once dismissed as cringe and fringe are being lauded in high places. I believe it is of urgent importance that Ordinary People push back against these trends and reaffirm in every way we know how that we have no intention of abandoning the core ethical principles that undergird a civil society: honest dealings, generosity of heart, support for humanitarian institutions, a spirit of welcome towards people fleeing violence, an ethic rooted in sharing rather than in hoarding, a determination to tackle problems collaboratively, and an avoidance of competitive bluster towards neighbors and allies.",
                "While I regularly donate to causes I believe in and participate in protests and visibility events, the arts always feel like my truest form of expression, and<span class=\"bold\"> I want to do more creative work that responds to our times with imagery that is also timeless</span>. &nbsp;",
                "\"No one is coming to save us\" people were saying in the dark days of early 2025 when the current U.S. administration took sudden aim at global alliances, refugee communities, crucial life-saving aid funding, public lands, free speech, democracy, the concept of empathy, and truth itself in a cascade of aggressive actions.&nbsp;<br><br>And I thought, without knowing whether it would prove true, <span class=\"bold\">\"We. We are coming to save us.\"</span>",
                "It's 2026 now. Our democracy is still under assault and we have been living through the nightmare of an active constitutional crisis for well over a year. But in the midst of all this, someone has been coming through and it's no one you've heard of. It's not a film star or a CEO or a senate minority leader. It's just this: ordinary people.",
                "All year long, ordinary people have been showing up to show care and support for their struggling communities and imperiled neighbors.",
                "Showing up to show a spirit of resistance towards the hardhearted cruelty and rampant lawlessness presently on display in the halls of power.",
                "Showing that rescue and resistance are often two sides of the very same coin.",
                "Ordinary people have been organizing food drives, fundraisers, and charity auctions to counter the worst affects of irresponsible funding cuts. Ordinary people have been giving up their time off to flock to protests by the millions. Ordinary people have stood outdoors in blowing snow and blazing heat to hold signs demanding moral courage from elected leaders. Ordinary people have been speaking up in public forums fully aware that using their voices may cost them friendships and business opportunities. Ordinary people have poured countless hours into vetting information in a disinformation hellscape, curating resources for their communities, and expressing resistance in poetry, painting, and song.",
                "We may feel small in the scheme of things, but there are so, so many of us. When each of us is doing the thing we know how to do, Ordinary People are a force that won't be easily stopped.",
                "These \"tunnel book\" paper theatre scenes are complex and extremely time-consuming to design and create. It typically takes me a full work week to make one, and handmade pieces that require this level of time and attention seldom sell for anything close to a living wage. Tackling this kind of project is thus a major financial commitment, and it keeps me away from work that can more reliably pay my bills. I've been dreaming about expanding this paper theatre series for over six months now, but have been kept away from it for financial reasons. Getting some upfront funding for this series via Kickstarter will allow me to take the necessary time away from gig work to make what is on my soul while the time is right.<br><br>Of course, depending on which support tier backers gravitate towards, the majority of the funds raised in this campaign will likely go directly towards printing, packaging, and shipping the little art prints that capture the new paper theatre scene(s) I create.",

                "Sarajevo, between the 50s and the end of the 20th century, had a central place in the artistic and cultural scene of the Balkans. A city that promoted the creation of art, where artist were close to their public, their work accessible and important to society, cultural centres were thriving, concerts, exhibitions and plays were the constantly happening, and visited in high numbers. Following the war of 1992, Sarajevo struggled to rebuild this cultural fervour, artists were no longer receiving the means to create and promote their work, places that were once dedicated to that effort, mostly public establishments, were either given new functions or left to abandonment.&nbsp;",
                "Today, Sarajevo is a city where culture and art clearly still hold the same importance it once did, but most artists eventually bump into the wall that is the lack of a space to show their work, to make it exist in society. It is now difficult for artists, particularly young emerging artists, to get the exposure and remuneration they need, not only making a career in art very difficult, which in turn makes their work difficult for the public to access and appreciate their work.&nbsp;",
                "The spirit and potential that fuelled the once thriving cultural and artistic scene of Sarajevo is still there, it however suffers from a lack of support and opportunities to express itself, the same can be said for the whole region.",
                "I am Sasha Mingasson, one of the young aforementioned emerging artists, during a brief period in the academy of fine arts of Sarajevo, I have met many young talented artists, full of ambitions, ideas and most importantly, with the will to contribute to the reconstruction of the local artistic scene. What they are lacking the most, is an outlet and the finances (or a prospect of remuneration), without which no artistic project can come to realisation, nor is a career in art feasible. It is because of this lack of prospect that lots of people with a passion and talent for art end up looking for a career elsewhere, which often, leads to a great and dangerous loss of authentic regional culture and art.&nbsp;",
                "It isn't for a lack of interest in art, because of an apathy and disinterest in culture that the situation is as it is, the few cultural events that do take place, such as the SFF (Sarajevo film festival), Jazz Fest, or exhibitions in the national gallery, are all visited in high numbers and are something that locals are proud of. These are things that are highly sought after, the only problem is the lack of funding, initiatives and spaces dedicated to art.&nbsp;",
                "In this in response to these difficulties, with the ambition to give these young emerging artists a voice and a presence in society, that i am opening Mezzanine. A space for this generation of artists to express themselves, to give them the public they need.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;Mezzanine is a multi-functional space, it will be a gallery that also functions as a print shop, with a small screen printing studio on the floor. Every month a different artist will use the exhibition space to exhibit his works, as of right now there are three artists in line, Ryan O'Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) and Tristan Berthoud (@Obscutrist). That space will also be used to display a catalogue of prints (mostly screen printed and giclee prints) from young artists of the region as well as to exhibit some of my works.&nbsp;",
                "The silk-screen printing studio will allow “Mezzanine” to have its own in-house production of screen printed prints, and give those artists the opportunity to print series of their works. It will also be used to print on hoodies and shirts, creating a collection of clothes with artworks by young local artists, not only turning their art into something wearable, but is also one of the best ways to get their works to be seen and talked about.",
                "The studio will also function as the economical backbone of the gallery, by offering screen printing services to businesses, a sort of an financial safety net.",
                "To make this project a reality, i need your help shouldering the initial costs. To give a second life to the space, and to acquire the material to set the studio up.&nbsp;",
                "The funds would go in the following :&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">all available works for postcards and prints will be communicated to backers at the end of the campaign. &nbsp;They will either be works of Sasha Mingasson or Tristan Berthoud, the choice is yours to make.&nbsp;</span>",
                "Sarajevo, entre les années 50 et la fin du XXe siècle, occupait une place centrale sur la scène artistique et culturelle des Balkans. C’était une ville qui encourageait la création artistique, où les artistes étaient proches de leur public, où leurs œuvres étaient accessibles et jouaient un rôle important dans la société. Les centres culturels étaient florissants ; concerts, expositions et pièces de théâtre se succédaient en permanence et attiraient un large public.&nbsp;",
                "À la suite de la guerre de 1992, Sarajevo a eu du mal à retrouver cet élan culturel. Les artistes ne disposaient plus des moyens nécessaires pour créer et promouvoir leur travail, et les lieux autrefois dédiés à cette mission — principalement des établissements publics — ont été réaffectés à d’autres usages ou laissés à l’abandon.&nbsp;",
                "Aujourd’hui, Sarajevo est une ville où la culture et l’art ont clairement conservé l’importance qu’ils avaient autrefois. Pourtant, la plupart des artistes finissent par se heurter à un obstacle majeur : le manque d’espaces pour exposer leur travail, pour leur permettre d’exister au sein de la société. Il est désormais difficile pour les artistes, en particulier les jeunes artistes émergents, d’obtenir la visibilité et la rémunération dont ils ont besoin. Cela rend non seulement une carrière artistique difficilement réalisable, mais limite également l’accès du public à leurs œuvres et sa capacité à les apprécier. L’esprit et le potentiel qui ont nourri la scène culturelle et artistique autrefois florissante de Sarajevo sont toujours présents.",
                "&nbsp;Cependant, ils souffrent d’un manque de soutien et d’opportunités pour s’exprimer. Cette ville, tout comme la région entière, a besoin de d'avantage de lieux pour exprimer et montrer son identité artistique, son âme. C’est un territoire riche de jeunes talents motivés qui restent invisibles. Dans ce contexte, chaque effort en faveur de la promotion de la culture et de l’art est essentiel. Je suis convaincue qu’avec un léger coup de pouce, ces jeunes artistes peuvent à nouveau occuper une place centrale dans la société d’aujourd’hui. Je souhaite y contribuer à mon échelle, en apportant ma propre pierre à l’édifice sous la forme d'une gallerie consacré à la promotion des jeunes artistes locaux émergents : <span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span>.",
                "Je m’appelle Sasha Mingasson, et je fais partie de ces jeunes artistes émergents mentionnés plus haut. Durant une brève période passée à l’Académie des Beaux-Arts de Sarajevo, j’ai rencontré de nombreux jeunes artistes talentueux, pleins d’ambition et d’idées, et surtout animés par la volonté de participer à la reconstruction de la scène artistique locale. Ce qui leur manque le plus, c’est un espace d’expression et des moyens financiers (ou une perspective de rémunération), sans lesquels aucun projet artistique ne peut voir le jour, et aucune carrière artistique n’est viable. C’est précisément faute de perspectives que de nombreuses personnes passionnées et talentueuses finissent par s’orienter vers d’autres carrières, ce qui conduit trop souvent à des œuvres et des artistes potentiels qui ne verront jamais le jour.",
                "&nbsp;La situation actuelle n’est pas due à un manque d’intérêt pour l’art, ni à une apathie ou un désintérêt pour la culture. Les rares événements culturels existants — tels que le SFF (Sarajevo Film Festival), le Jazz Fest ou les expositions à la Galerie nationale — attirent un public nombreux et constituent une véritable fierté locale. Ces événements sont très attendus ; le problème réside dans le manque de financements, d’initiatives et d’espaces dédiés à l’art.",
                "C'est en réponse à ces difficultés, avec l'ambition de donner à ces jeunes artistes émergents une voix et une présence dans la société, que j'ouvre Mezzanine. Un espace où cette jeune génération d'artistes pourra s'exprimer, et qui pourra leur donner une audience.&nbsp;",
                "&nbsp;<span class=\"bold\">Mezzanine</span> sera un espace multifonctionnel : une galerie qui fera également office de boutique de tirages (reproductions/prints), avec un petit atelier de sérigraphie intégré. Chaque mois, un artiste différent utilisera l’espace d’exposition pour présenter ses œuvres. À ce jour, trois artistes sont déjà prévus : Ryan O’Hara (@Zlo_u_potrebi), BOTCH (no.xylene) et Tristan Berthoud. Cet espace servira également à présenter un catalogue d’estampes (principalement des sérigraphies et des impressions giclée) réalisées par de jeunes artistes de la région, ainsi que certaines de mes propres œuvres.",
                "&nbsp;L’atelier de sérigraphie permettra à Mezzanine d’assurer une production interne de tirages en sérigraphie et d’offrir aux artistes la possibilité d’imprimer des séries de leurs œuvres. Il servira également à imprimer sur des sweats à capuche et des t-shirts, afin de créer une collection de vêtements ornés d’œuvres de jeunes artistes locaux. Cela permettra non seulement de rendre leur art portable, mais aussi d’en favoriser la diffusion et la visibilité. L’atelier constituera également l’ossature économique de la galerie, en proposant des services de sérigraphie aux entreprises — une sorte de filet de sécurité financier.",
                "Pour concrétiser ce projet, j’ai besoin de votre soutien afin de couvrir les coûts initiaux. Il s’agit de redonner vie à l’espace et d’acquérir le matériel nécessaire à l’installation de l’atelier.",

Our team brings over two decades of experience in developing practical modeling solutions for hobbyists, built on the shared knowledge of modelers across many genres and from all around the world.",
                "A little over a year ago, we introduced <span class=\"bold\">Ionic Smart Colors</span>, a new line created to support wargamers, tabletop gamers, and figure painters with that same experience and a shared passion. Thanks to your support, this new line, representing a new space for us, has continued to grow and evolve. We are truly grateful to the community for welcoming Ionic Smart Colors so warmly.",
                "Your feedback has always guided our work, and we’ve always listened. After many requests for more metallic colors, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to Ionic: the <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal</span> range...",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal </span>has been designed to provide hobbyists with all the metallics they could need for any project, from the classic silvers and golds, to metallics reds, blues, and more, with the same strengths and quality they are used to from Ionic. Featuring <span class=\"bold\">60 new</span> water-based acrylic paints in total, each color is manufactured with intense metallic pigments.&nbsp;",
                "<br>Each color is part of a set which provides an <span class=\"bold\">easy-to-use 3-Step Smart System</span> for painting true metallic metals consisting of a <span class=\"bold\">base, metallic wash, and highlight</span>. This system can be applied in order:<span class=\"bold\"> base &gt; metallic wash &gt; highlight</span> or varied based on personal preference, such as <span class=\"bold\">base &gt; highlight &gt; metallic wash</span>.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks to its simplicity, this system can be used by painters of <span class=\"bold\">any experience level</span>, whether you are a beginner painting your first army, or an experienced painter applying the metallic tones to your latest display piece. Real Heavy Metal is <span class=\"bold\">versatile </span>and can adapt to <span class=\"bold\">any technique</span> or method of application, be it brush, airbrush, drybrush, glazing, layering and more....&nbsp;",
                "The process of basecoat, wash, and highlight is a common methodology in any modeler's arsenal. However, because washes are typically matte, they can dull metallic finishes. Even glossy washes that preserve shine often reduce the metallic character of the pigments.",

Painting True Metallic Metals has never been more metal!&nbsp;",
                "The <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal Metallic Washes </span>are also highlighy pigmented. When used over metallics, this preserves the saturation and sheen of the metallic base color. However, when applied over a light color, such as white, they create shading and highlights with a single bushstroke. As you can see on the below example:",

                "<span class=\"bold\">With the Ionic Smart Lid and Bottle: </span>the Real Heavy Metal range uses the same bottles as other Ionic Smart Colors. A perfectly transparent and flexible bottle, ensures you always know the exact color inside, while its flexibility makes it easy to deposit the right amount of paint. The lid is easily opened and closed with one hand, without the need for unscrewing, and prevents spills or mess.&nbsp;",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Each bottle contains 20ml of paint</span>, ideal for large projects and demanding painters. Despite its larger quantity, the bottles are the same diameter as the smaller, commonly used 16 and 17ml bottles. This means they fit on your racks and storage solutions without issue.&nbsp;",
                "When we released Ionic Smart Colors, we were truly blown away by the response. After four years of development, it was incredibly rewarding to see how warmly the community received the Ionic formulation. At the same time, we heard a great deal of feedback that the range needed more metallic tones.",
                "With that in mind, we’ve spent the past year developing <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal</span>, and it’s now ready for release. We chose Kickstarter for this launch because it allows us to ensure hobbyists around the world receive their paints at the same time, while also giving us the opportunity to offer a special discount. We believe this is the fairest way to say thank you for the loyalty and support that has helped shape and grow Ionic. It also allows us to gauge demand so that <span class=\"bold\">no body is left waiting</span> for a second production run.",
                "Shipping costs will be collected <span class=\"bold\">after</span> the Kickstarter campaign ends. Once the campaign has concluded, we will contact all backers with a code for the pledge manager on our webstore. At that point, you will be able to select the specific sets and add-ons you would like. The webstore will calculate shipping options and costs based on the total weight and size of your pledge. We will then begin fulfilling your order.",
                "Pledges can be increased and add-ons added up until the time you pay for shipping. Our goal is to complete fulfillment by the end of <span class=\"bold\">September 2026</span>, although we will work hard to deliver your paints sooner. Production is ready to begin immediately, and the formulation has already been finalized.",
                "All items will ship from our warehouse <span class=\"bold\">in Spain</span>, from which we ship orders worldwide on a daily basis. Please note that backers may be responsible for customs duties, VAT, and other applicable import fees such as Tariffs. We please ask that you are aware of any such costs in your locality. Estimated shipping costs can be found on our webstore, by clicking <a href=\"https://www.migjimenez.com/en/content/1-entrega\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;",
                "Below you can watch videos made using the <span class=\"bold\">Real Heavy Metal </span>paints, we will update this list as more videos become available.",
                "Our team have already been putting the Real Heavy Metal range to work on their project, below you can see examples from their recent projects.&nbsp;"

                "The dream to become a small production potter is something I have possessed since high school. After acquiring my Fine Arts degree from Siena Heights University, I spent a decade without ceramics in my life at all. I never lost hope for my dream, and pressed on through jobs that weren’t my calling. A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to work as a studio assistant for Grayling Ceramics, owned by Shay and Maura Church. Grayling also got its start with the help of Kickstarter. Shay and Maura have provided me with the chance to hone my skills, and learn a great deal about how a small business operates. Harper Homestead Pottery will feature hand made wheel thrown ware that focuses on both function and details influenced by the natural world. While my business will be starting in my home, I do have a future goal to open a brick and mortar studio once I’ve grown the business. If my funds goal can be reached, I will finish out my basement studio, launch my website and business, and begin producing ware on a regular basis. I plan on continuing with my career at Grayling for now, until my business grows enough for me to go out on my own. I am excited to share my creative works with the world!&nbsp;"

                "Tarot cards have been used for eons to provide clarity around what feels overwhelmingly confusing, to confirm those little niggling feelings you have in your gut and can't quite place, or to provide a comforting cosmic squeeze to assure you that you are not alone.",
                "When you are standing at the threshold of your destiny, the cards can show you how to cross it.",
                "They are the Cosmic Translator - giving you the language to explain the feelings, fragmented thoughts, or physical sensations you experience when you are channeling divine guidance.",
                "And the symbols, artwork, colors, and composition of each card is what makes the language clear and concise.",
                "It is crucial to use a deck that you connect with visually, because that is what will make your messages come through, crystal clear.",
                "And that is why the Crystal Doorway Tarot was created.",
                "I wanted to reimagine the classic symbolism of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck in a way that will draw you in with its beauty and give you so many ways to clearly interpret what your intuition is trying to say.",
                "The digital collage art form allowed me to intuitively choose and layer exactly the right images to convey the traditional meanings of each card. And within those images, there are always going to be hidden details that reveal themselves only when necessary, allowing you to have a truly unique reading experience every single time.",
                "This deck consists of 78 full-color cards, with gold gilded edges.",
                "The card back design is unique for a tarot deck - the image is NOT the same whether the cards are upright or reversed! Honestly, I personally don't read reversals, so it didn't feel important to create the backs in a more traditional style.&nbsp;",
                "You will have the full Major Arcana and the four suits - Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles.",
                "There will also be a guidebook to inspire your intuition, not to lead it. Through more of a story-telling style you will be given a little insight to the meanings of each card but I always encourage you to listen to your own intuition before leaning on the guidebook for the answers!",
                "It is also important for me to say that this is not just another deck of pretty images.&nbsp;",
                "You will feel the emotions of the people and animals depicted on each card, through their facial expressions or body language. Your eyes will be drawn to the light flares and the colors and the tiniest details. And you will see images or symbols synchronized across various cards.",
                "All of these components were intentionally crafted to give you endless layers to peel back. Endless ways to interpret a card or combination of cards based on the context of the reading you are doing.&nbsp;",
                "This deck was created so that you can learn to trust your intuitive nudges based on the emotional hits you get when you see each card. To teach you how to translate the story that is trying to be told.",
                "This is the perfect deck for beginners and seasoned readers alike, and EVERYONE will see something different when they are pulling their cards. That is the magick of this deck.&nbsp;",
                "The Crystal Doorway is open - are you going to step through and see what clarity you find on the other side?"

                "This first chapter — <span class=\"bold\">Act I: The Inner Sanctum</span> — serves as the opening arc of a larger unfolding mythos. Future expansions will explore new ruins, deeper truths behind the Elixir, and the consequences of whatever choices players make here. Nothing in Atlantis ended cleanly. And nothing that awakens here will remain contained forever.",
                "This project was designed from the ground up for modern hybrid tabletop play. Instead of overwhelming Game Masters with dense rulebooks, we focused on tools that make encounters immersive and fast to run: High-detail STL miniatures for printing or digital use VTT-ready maps compatible with Foundry, Roll20, and Alchemy Encounter overlays, tokens, and environmental assets Modular DM Command Deck cheat systems Narrative hooks for different character archetypes Community-forged playtesting for balanced final stats Everything is structured to help Game Masters focus on storytelling rather than preparation fatigue.",

                "Long before the first empires carved their borders and before written history claimed authority over truth, there existed a civilization now known only through fractured legend — the Atlantean Ascendants. They did not conquer through armies or engines. They shaped existence through symbols, resonance, and an understanding of reality that modern minds would struggle to grasp. Their cities were instruments of power. White stone temples aligned to the heavens, corridors etched with sigils that hummed softly when walked upon, pillars that acted as anchors against forces unseen. Geometry was not decoration — it was technology. Language was not merely spoken — it was encoded into matter itself. Through these methods, they learned to stabilize energies that lay just beyond ordinary perception, energies ancient even then. For a time, their mastery seemed absolute. Their world prospered in a quiet brilliance that bordered on the sacred. Yet the deeper they looked into the fabric of existence, the more they began to sense that something vast was looking back. And still… they continued.",
                "Their greatest endeavor was not born of war or fear, but of ambition — a longing to transcend the fragile limits of mortality. From decades of research into alchemy, cosmic resonance, and sigil harmonics came the creation of the Crimson Elixir: a living medium said to bridge flesh and eternity. It shimmered with a beauty that unsettled even its creators, like liquid starlight laced with something darker. The Ascendants believed it could heal divine wounds, expand consciousness, and allow a chosen vessel to step beyond humanity without losing it. Mirelle was chosen. Brilliant. Attuned. Revered by many, quietly feared by others. Whether she volunteered out of hope, duty, or something more private remains debated in the fragments of surviving lore. What is known is that she entered the Inner Sanctum willingly — the most sacred convergence point of Atlantean architecture — where the final ascension ritual began. For a moment, everything aligned perfectly. Then reality began to resist.",
                "Witness accounts, though incomplete, describe a sudden stillness before the collapse — as if the world itself held its breath. No one knows why the sigils that had stabilized Atlantis for generations faltered. Energy surged without harmony. Structures meant to anchor dimensional forces began to fracture from within. The Inner Sanctum sealed itself instinctively, an automatic defense mechanism activated by forces far older than the <span class=\"bold\">Ascendants</span>. Entire districts vanished without a sound. Guardians awakened, not to protect the people, but to contain what had been unleashed. Mirelle did not die. But neither did she remain wholly human. The Crimson Elixir fused with her in a way no one had predicted, binding her to something vast, patient, and profoundly alien. She became a living anomaly — a nexus where reality bends, memory distorts, and time seems uncertain. Atlantis fell from history soon after. Survivors scattered. Records faded. Myths replaced memory. Yet the Sanctum never truly slept. It waited. And now, the seals are weakening after thousands of years - waiting for the right people to reactivate them.",
                "The Inner Sanctum is only the beginning. Future arcs will explore: Other Atlantean ruins, Hidden factions and guardians, The deeper truth behind the Crimson Elixir And what Mirelle’s awakening truly means for the world. Some answers may illuminate. Others may raise questions far more unsettling.",

                "I am raising funds for the purpose of skill sharing and cross cultural bridge building. I want to give away art materials to local Thai people and teach them how to use the materials for free. Ultimately, I want to promote a different kind of tourism by creating a Mecca for artists, which attracts artists from all over the world. I want to help the best practitioners from amongst my students to use their new skills to create fabulous art with a local theme and to teach others by putting on their own workshops. My name is Philip Potter. I am an artist. I am a teacher. I am a writer. And I have severe ET, a neurological disability similar to Parkinson’s disease. So, if I can do it, anyone can.&nbsp;<br><br>The starting point is the island of Phuket, Thailand. I have been offered a venue there to put on workshops and start an art club. I am hopeful that the project will become self-sustaining in approximately 12 months. To pay for the venue, I will teach art classes to the kindergarten pupils at my friend’s school as a way to pay her back for allowing me to use the school after the pupils have gone home. I intend to run art classes for the growing expatriate community - Thailand has been very proactive in making a welcoming environment for retired western people with easy access to long term visas etc. and an art class is a good way to meet new people and reduce isolation. I will also offer art workshops to visiting tourists who come from all over the world - people who want to experience something new. Once developed, these potential income streams will allow me to offer free art materials and art classes to local Thai people, building a bridge between all three communities. I intend to do this using Claude Monet landscapes aka Monet Magic. There is a strong historical connection between French Impressionism and Thailand, which became popular there in the mid twentieth century.&nbsp;",
                "The Monet Magic idea was developed while teaching in Indonesia - I needed a method that produced quick wins as well as a lasting sense of achievement. This technique works in all areas, from private one-to-one lessons to corporate well-being workshops. It turns ‘can’t do’ staff into ‘can do’ staff and it tackles the reluctant artist’s fear of facing a blank piece of paper. Any problem can be solved with the right approach, the right tools and the right techniques. I can teach anyone to replicate a Monet landscape in 2-3 hours using a step-by-step mixed media approach. The resulting paintings leave the participants both amazed and excited over what they have achieved.&nbsp;<br><br>Being able to visually interpret the world around you and the world inside you is a ticket to better mental health and well-being as well as a saleable skill. Using your brain in a variety of ways can help in every area of life, leading to higher level thinking and more robust levels of concentration. This technique releases gamma waves in the brain in the same way solving a complex maths problem leads to a eureka moment - but without the maths. Monet is just the vehicle for the technique - once you have mastered the process you will be ready to create your own masterpieces quickly and confidently.&nbsp;",
                "In a class, everyone paints the same picture. You will be taken through a step-by-step process. Everything is explained and demonstrated, so whether you learn better visually or through instruction your needs are catered for and as I show you what to do there is no language barrier. The painting is broken down into its constituent elements and rebuilt from the ground up. The class ends when the participant’s painting looks as near as possible a twin to the original. The process takes approximately 3 hours. It works like magic.",

                "My story with clay began in a high school ceramics classroom exactly 28 years ago. I fell in love with the tactile, transformative nature of the medium, but as life often does, it called me in a different direction. I set that dream aside to focus on being a mother and a wife, dedicating years to building a family and a home. The clay was gone from my hands, but the artist inside was simply waiting.",
                "Ten years ago, life shifted. Following a divorce and a beautiful new marriage, my husband and I were shopping for the everyday items to furnish our new home together. I found myself deeply dissatisfied with the commercial mugs, bowls, and plates we were finding. They felt soulless and lacked character.",
                "When I told my husband that these pieces were boring and that I believed I could do better, he didn't just nod—he gave me the push I needed. He asked why I wasn't creating, and he encouraged me to pick up the practice again.",
                "I returned to the studio a decade ago and haven’t looked back. Today, DYRPottery is the realization of a dream that has been in my heart for nearly three decades.",
                "My work is a celebration of the human touch. I choose not to use a pottery wheel; instead, I focus on the rhythmic, intentional methods of slabs, coils, and pinch posts. This process allows me to build a piece from the ground up, feeling the character of the clay in every seam and texture. By hand-building, I ensure that every mug, bowl, and plate has its own unique silhouette. When you hold a piece of DYRPottery, you are holding a piece of a story—one that is \"perfectly imperfect\" and entirely handmade.",
                "I have been creating and selling pieces to friends and family, but to truly bring my work to the public and scale my studio, I need to \"bring the fire\" home.",
                "I am fundraising to purchase and install a professional-grade kiln, including the necessary 240V electrical work and specialized ventilation.",

I was even contemplating if I should spend the extra money to get the red ones and then sell the black ones but then I noticed that you can't get all the red with slipcases in the add on.

Xel has a much better idea to soothe Marnie’s troubled spirit: an internship in the hopeless bureaucracy of the trans-dimensional Department of Spectral Affairs!\n\nThis new do-gooder duo has their work cut out for them in a series of hilarious mishaps and misadventures throughout the space-time continuum (but mostly in and around the office) as Marnie finds pathways through her feelings of worthlessness by helping others."

In another time, the two women would have kept one another’s company forever in their little attic bedroom, living out their days in the employ of a Lord. But it’s now the dawn of a new age. The expanding empire has brought with it not only plundered wealth, but worldliness and new ideas. Suffragists agitate in the street, idle-rich bohemians challenge sexual mores, and Patience and Esther slowly come to realize the world is wider and full of more adventure and opportunity than they ever imagined."

It was the start of a very strange friendship!\n\nAfter Skylla, the deadly fanged mermaid, mysteriously lets Corinth live, they grow closer through a cautious exchange of stories, gifts, jokes, and sign language. Mermaids, it turns out, eat people, but however terrifying Skylla may look, she’s a little younger, a little smaller, and perhaps a little too soft for all that. Bewitched by Corinth and their growing bond, she learns about all the best things in life on land: books, burgers, donuts, and this strange chattering human sound called laughter. But a storm is brewing—both at sea and in Corinth’s increasingly dangerous relationship with her obsessively jealous boyfriend—and a magical bargain may be the only thing that can save her, at a tremendous cost."

It was the start of a very strange friendship!\n\nAfter Skylla, the deadly fanged mermaid, mysteriously lets Corinth live, they grow closer through a cautious exchange of stories, gifts, jokes, and sign language. Mermaids, it turns out, eat people, but however terrifying Skylla may look, she’s a little younger, a little smaller, and perhaps a little too soft for all that. Bewitched by Corinth and their growing bond, she learns about all the best things in life on land: books, burgers, donuts, and this strange chattering human sound called laughter. But a storm is brewing—both at sea and in Corinth’s increasingly dangerous relationship with her obsessively jealous boyfriend—and a magical bargain may be the only thing that can save her, at a tremendous cost."

The only problem is, for everything he knows about magic, he knows nothing about adventuring, and he’ll have to figure this one out as he goes, far from the comforting safety of home. \n\nIn over his head, along with his equally inexperienced new allies, Dr. Baer sets out on a dangerous quest through a world of monsters and magic to set things right . . . and to find his next chapter."

In another time, the two women would have kept one another’s company forever in their little attic bedroom, living out their days in the employ of a Lord. But it’s now the dawn of a new age. The expanding empire has brought with it not only plundered wealth, but worldliness and new ideas. Suffragists agitate in the street, idle-rich bohemians challenge sexual mores, and Patience and Esther slowly come to realize the world is wider and full of more adventure and opportunity than they ever imagined."

A magnificent, sensual anthology, that unites eighteenth century experts of licentious verse with top tier artists and twentieth century foxes such as Mœbius, Liberatore (<span class=\"text-italic\">RanXerox</span>), Loustal, and Bess. Within these pages, the dreamy drawings of Beb-deum illustrate the erotic words of Belleau, the bawdyness of Pierre Motin meets the frank and straightforward line of Chauzy, and Mœbius packs the rhymes and assonances of Patin de la Fizelière into a psychedelic comic strip worthy of his greatest works.

This work, a series of vignettes, is a singular amalgamation of literary poetics, high art, and comics dedicated to the sensuality of women whose fantasies Varenne not only reveals, but arouses to fruition, and to the passion of various couples who find themselves in liminal spaces illuminated by mutual desire. <img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/642/634/be9c696217568d1f34b76e4833a519d8_original.jpg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1771372099&amp;width=2304&amp;sig=1UACj7wM72FbfMBwusGpePpyvxHIKhOkW9CgMYFW89Q%3D\" data-id=\"52642634\">",

In this climate of tension and transformation, where institutions were questioned and hierarchies challenged, <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant </span></span>and <span class=\"bold\">Humanoids</span> were born. Rather than retreating into the shadows, their founding fathers chose to seize their chosen medium to push against boundaries and conventions, giving voice to their fears, their dissent, and their wildest dreams and fantasies.",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant,</span></span><span class=\"bold\"> since its origins, has been very open about sex and the representation of sexuality, including its oft-deviant nature, but always with a unique elegance that honored and explored, as opposed to mere exploitation.</span> There are countless treasures published throughout Humanoids’ early years, one of the most profound being the sophisticated yet vulgar allegory of <span class=\"text-italic\">Polonius</span>, penned by Picaret and illustrated by the renowned Jacques Tardi. Originally published in 1976, the rare, complete, 44-page tale is republished in English (for the first time since 1977) in <span class=\"text-italic\">Metal Hurlant Issue 4: Paradise Lost, </span>available through this campaign. <span class=\"text-italic\">Read more about the careful technique used at the time to create gray tones, both in this work by Tardi and in Varenne’s, A Feast for the Eyes.</span>",

                "In this major work and those that followed, Alex Varenne came into his own with his iconic chiaroscuro style, rendering men and women alike not only in a sensual and attractive light, but with a quintessential ’80s awareness of fashion and beauty, elevating his rather explicit material into realms of higher, more sophisticated graphic art.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">A word from the publisher about Varenne and Tardi’s gray-tone technique</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">When Tardi drew the pages of </span><span class=\"bold\">Polonius</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> fifty years ago, computers were not part of the process. If an artist wanted black-and-white pages with nuanced gray atmospheres, options were limited. You could paint the page in gray wash, but printing results were uncertain. Or, to keep dense black lines, you could draw the page, then paint the gray areas on a reduced reproduction of the original, printed in blue on paint-friendly paper, which would be scanned and combined with the film from the original black line. It worked, but it was complicated and costly.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">The alternative, if you were meticulous, patient, and talented, was self-adhesive screentone: in Europe, Letraset; in the United States, Zip-A-Tone. Charles M. Schulz used it for the gray spots in his Peanuts strips, though in a light and simple way.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Screentone was a transparent adhesive sheet printed with a halftone pattern. You cut it to shape and applied it directly to the original art, where it stayed in place, or you laid it over the area to be shaded and trimmed away the excess with an artist’s knife. These pages are surprisingly hard to reproduce today, and modern printing does not automatically make it easier.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Several key works in this campaign, Varenne’s </span><span class=\"bold\">Tears of Sex</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> and Tardi and Picaret’s </span>Polonius<span class=\"text-italic\"> (as published in </span><span class=\"bold\">Metal Hurlant Issue 4</span><span class=\"text-italic\">), were made with this method, which gives them the distinctive gray tones we love, a look largely lost since the arrival of digital tools.</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">Only a few cartoonists truly mastered it. Varenne pushed the technique to its limit. He drew on acetate with a pen and brush, using ink that bites into the plastic, then applied screentone to the reverse of the transparent sheet to build those atmospheric grays. The first time I met him, in early 1989 to discuss </span><span class=\"bold\">Tears of Sex</span><span class=\"text-italic\"> (the year I took over Humanoids), Alex told me that inking on plastic made the line extra fluid and helped the spontaneity he was after while inking. You can catch a glimpse of his breathtaking originals in the opening scene of this campaign’s video (yes, they are originals...).</span>",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\">To my knowledge, among all the artists Humanoids has worked with over the past fifty years, Varenne is the only one who used this unique technique and did wonders with it. Even beyond Humanoids, I do not see another comparable example.</span>",

                "All funds raised through sponsorships, donations, and patrons will be used entirely to support the development and ongoing improvement of this interactive cyberpunk suspense and horror graphic novel / experience.<br>Specifically, the money will go toward:<br>Paying our programmers, who are building the interactivity, branched narrative paths, sanity system, dynamic glitches, choice mechanics, and exclusive post-credits content.<br>Compensating our writers, who are responsible for crafting the deep storylines, disturbing dialogue, revelations about Dc. Micron Skyrunner, the mysteries of the Funhouse, and the dark cyberpunk tone that makes this work unique.<br>There are no middlemen or unnecessary expenses: every dollar contributed goes directly to the people creating and expanding this universe for you.<br>Thanks to your support, we can continue to pay for their talent, time, and dedication to deliver more chapters, alternate endings, hidden files, and updates that make Micron’s amusement park increasingly twisted and immersive.<br>Your contribution doesn’t just fund a project — it keeps the glitch alive and allows the creators to keep dreaming (and terrifying) alongside us!",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Singularity</span></span><br>A scientific horror interactive graphic novel<br>A sealed mansion.<br>A forgotten laboratory.<br>Hundreds of inactive androids… staring at nothing.<br>And one name erased from every record:<br>Dr. Micron Skyrunner.<br>Singularity is an interactive graphic novel that blends scientific horror, psychological mystery, and puzzle-driven exploration. Every object is a clue. Every room is a question. Every discovery changes what you think is real.<br>You awaken with fragmented memories inside the abandoned Skyrunner Complex — a research facility shut down after an experiment that should never have existed.<br>No bodies.<br>No staff.<br>Only humanoid machines standing in silent rows… and systems that still power on as if they were waiting for you.<br>Something here recognizes you.<br>🧠 Gameplay<br>Inspired by classic point-and-click adventures and narrative horror experiences:<br>Side-scroll exploration through detailed pixel-art environments<br>Interactive inventory (inspect, rotate, combine objects)<br>Logic-based puzzles grounded in physics and real science<br>Sanity system: what you see may not be trustworthy<br>Branching narrative choices and multiple endings<br>Environmental storytelling through notes, photos, recordings, and fragmented memories<br>Nothing is decorative.<br>A rusted ring. A family photograph. An android’s outstretched hand.<br>Everything tells a story.<br>🔬 Science + Horror<br>The facility is built around real scientific concepts:<br>Gravitational singularities<br>Consciousness transfer<br>Quantum entanglement<br>Neural replication<br>Artificial intelligence ethics<br>Temporal paradoxes<br>These aren’t background themes.<br>Solving science is how you survive.<br>📖 Story<br>Dr. Micron Skyrunner was a prodigy.<br>A physicist obsessed with defeating death itself.<br>His research promised to “preserve humanity.”<br>Then funding vanished.<br>Staff resigned.<br>The project was buried.<br>And then… silence.<br>Now you explore his mansion-laboratory, reconstructing his final days through broken memories, incomplete androids, and experiments that still feel alive.<br>Soon, a deeper question emerges:<br>Was Skyrunner trying to save humanity… or replace it?<br>And something worse:<br>Are you truly an investigator… or the Doctor’s last experiment?",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Why did I choose this linear format instead of episodes?</span></span><br>I want the story to feel like an immersive movie or graphic novel: intense, emotional, and with an uninterrupted rhythm. Every decision matters because it's part of an organic whole, and the impact of your choices builds gradually toward the climax and ending (with multiple possible conclusions depending on your paths).",
                "<span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">And a demo?</span></span><br>If the campaign is successful and we reach (or exceed) the funding goal, my plan is to release a free playable demo 2 month before the official launch of the full game. This demo will include the introduction + the first major story arc (about 20-25% of the full experience), so more people can try it, experience the atmosphere, and share it.<br>This way, all backers get exclusive early access to the complete version first, while the demo helps build wider interest and community in the lead-up to release.",
                "How We Plan to Create It (Main Steps from Now to Final Delivery)<br>Currently, the full direction of the story is already complete: we have the entire script, narrative structure with all arcs, branches, revelations, well-developed characters, and detailed emotional handling. This allows us to move forward in a very focused and efficient way.<br>The main steps are as follows:<br>Final Writing and Refinement (ongoing / nearly complete): Polish dialogues, ensure consistency across branches and the sanity system, and prepare all text for integration.<br>Art and Visual Assets (in progress): Create or finalize pixel art environments, character sprites, backgrounds, and interactive elements, using tools like Adobe Firefly for quick prototypes followed by manual refinement. (IA)<br>Programming and Interactivity (next major step): Our programming team will implement the core mechanics: choice-based system (clicking buttons to select options/dialogues), branched paths, simple inventory, sanity system (with dynamic visual glitches and effects), and logic-based puzzles rooted in real science. The game is primarily choice-based (button selections for narrative decisions), combined with light point-and-click elements (clicking objects to inspect, rotate, or combine them), making it accessible and heavily focused on horror storytelling.",
                "<br>Integration and Internal Testing (after programming): Combine all elements (art + narrative + code), test branches, choice outcomes, sanity balance, bugs, and performance across different Windows PCs.<br>Beta Testing with Backers (optional, if time/margin allows): Share an early version with a small group of backers for feedback and final polishing.",
                "&nbsp;Compile the complete version as a Windows executable (.exe), package it, and deliver to all backers.<br>The entire process is designed to be linear and efficient, thanks to the existing narrative foundation.<br>How We Will Distribute It<br>Main Format: Digital download DRM-free as a Windows executable (.exe). This is a standard, secure, and straightforward option for indie narrative games like this: backers simply download the file, run it, and play offline without any additional client or constant internet connection required.<br>Primary Distribution Platform: We will use itch.io (the most popular and reliable platform for DRM-free indie games). We’ll set up a private or restricted project page exclusively for backers, where they can download the .exe directly (or via the itch.io app, which handles automatic updates). itch.io is perfect because:<br>It supports importing your Kickstarter backer list directly (via CSV export from Kickstarter), granting automatic access to matching emails.<br>Allows private/restricted pages, exclusive download keys, or backer-only URLs for secure delivery.<br>Handles updates seamlessly: upload a new version (patches, bug fixes, extra content), and backers get notified and can download automatically.<br>It's free to publish, widely used by the indie community (especially for horror/narrative titles), and ensures true DRM-free ownership.<br>Alternatives if Needed: For extra security, we can provide private links via Google Drive or Dropbox for specific backers, but itch.io will be the main hub for simplicity and reliability. In the future, if the project expands significantly, we may consider adding Steam support, but the priority is DRM-free and easy access right from launch.<br>Updates and New Content: Any patches, bug fixes, additional chapters (if expanded post-launch), or extra content will be uploaded directly to the same itch.io page. Backers will receive automatic notifications (via email or the itch.io app) and can download updates at no extra cost. We’ll also use Kickstarter updates to announce and explain changes.<br>This ensures all backers receive the full game first, in a clear, hassle-free way. If the project grows, we’ll evaluate ports for Mac/Linux, but the initial focus is Windows for fastest delivery.<br>&nbsp;"

                "<span class=\"bold\">The day my mom Deborah died in 2024, someone gave me a popular book on Jewish grief. Like most resources on Jewish grief, it was normatively masculine and heteronormative. The tome included a large section on whether women’s voices were too holy to participate (yikes).&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">But I desperately needed a similar resource that would instruct me about Jewish grief and what was expected of me. My friends and loved ones needed one too.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Thus </span><span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Jewish Weirdo’s Guide to Grief </span></span><span class=\"bold\">was born.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">In writing my book, I took inspiration from a long line of Jewish graphic novelists and cartoonists – Stan Lee and Art Spiegelman for two notable examples. Graphic novels have a long Jewish history of helping us parse hard topics through funny or subversive pictures.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Who is this book for?&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">You might ask, who is a Jewish weirdo? I claim this term for everyone like me who draws from the margins toward the middle, who enjoys or is curious about inclusive Judaism.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">My friends and loved ones, who wanted to be supportive during the aninut (period of time between death and burial), shiva, and beyond, needed a resource like this. They wanted to support me but didn't know what was expected of them or what to say.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">&nbsp;Jewish or not, if you want to help someone grieve Jewishly, you’re enough of a Jewish weirdo for me.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">We all feel lost and alone in times of great grief. In times such as these, Judaism has ancient scripts for us to follow. I want to show my readers how those ancient scripts, updated for my modern lens, helped me and can help them.&nbsp;</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">For one example, shiva practice instructs us to stay close to each other for the first seven days of grief. “Show up and give them silence,” an ancient Jewish precept about shiva, is one of my personal favorites.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">In the midst of grief, there may simply be nothing you can say. You can sit next to the griever and look into the crater where their life used to be.</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">But over and over, Jewish practice has helped me feel surrounded by care in the midst of devastating grief. I hope that my book will be a light-hearted introduction to the ways Judaism helps us move toward each other in grief.</span>",

Black Heart, an imprint of Every Day is Valentine's Day Publishing, was born out of necessity and a refusal to be silenced.\r\n\r\nI started writing because I had to. All other doors were closed, so I had to kick one open. I began with children’s books, but I moved into comics because the world needed a 'Wolf' that the gatekeepers were too soft to provide. While the sheep were following weak leaders and pulling wool over everyone's eyes with soft stories and fragile heroes, I was sharpening my teeth.\r\n\r\nWe are Wolves. We are hungry. I’m in the kitchen, let me cook. It’s time to eat. It’s time for Absolute Change.",

                "Mohammad&nbsp;Sayed&nbsp;(Moh), a disability rights advocate, inventor, and motivational speaker, disabled himself as a youngster in Afghanistan, started his mission to “redefine normal” by promoting and advocating accessibility and inclusion for wheelchair users and the disabled at large. Now through Lets Roll Productions, Moh continues this mission with powerful stories told with dynamic graphic novels and short films that inspire and empower disabled people to be heroes in their own right - everyday. If you have followed our stories up to now, you already know that LRP’s first disabled superhero, Wheelchair Man came to life in 2016 and told the story of a fragmented childhood and the rocky path to becoming a superhero. Moh is faced with the ultimate consequences of war at a very young age. His childhood is abruptly halted by the all too common violence against civilians. By confronting his physical obstacles and tremendous loss, Moh is able to gain an extraordinary ability. This power allows Moh to aid and prevent harm to those who experience similar losses due to the brutality of war. Wheelchair Man’s story resonated with over 4,000 readers across Afghanistan, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, and the United States. The story was translated into Dari and Pashto, printed, and distributed throughout these countries. Notably, the state department sponsored these trips.&nbsp;",

This graphic novel not only tells her inspiring story but also highlights the strength, resilience, and potential of individuals with disabilities to overcome seemingly impossible odds to achieve their dreams and help others to do the same.",

                "We took an honest look at the <span class=\"bold\">tools people end up discarding</span>; bent spindles, missing bits, shredded bits, over-moulded parts.&nbsp;<br><br>Failures that come not just from <span class=\"bold\">use</span>, but from how they were <span class=\"bold\">made</span>.<br><br>Tools keep getting fussier and strangely disposable. And that never sat right with us. We believe <span class=\"bold\">repair shouldn’t feel harder than replacement</span>. It should feel intuitive and empowering.<br><br>That belief shaped everything that came next -<br><br><span class=\"bold\">WE WANTED TO MAKE REPAIR TOOL, REPAIRABLE.</span><br><span class=\"bold\">A TOOL FOR VERSATALITY, VERSATILE.</span>",
                "Meet the Combine Driver — a modular, repairable 2-in-1 ratchet and torque screwdriver designed for everyday repair and making.",
                "Engineered for precision, built for longevity, and designed as a complete desktop system, it brings torque control, modular bits, and sustainable construction into one thoughtfully designed tool.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">A BIT STACK THAT GROWS&nbsp;</span><br><span class=\"bold\">WITH YOUR NEEDS.</span><br><br>Most <span class=\"bold\">bit sets are designed as constrained solutions to changing needs.</span> You buy them once and replace them entirely when you need additional bits or wear out the existing ones.<br><br>We didn’t want that.<br><br>The Combine Driver Stack was <span class=\"bold\">designed as an adaptive system, not a rigid set</span>. A modular kit that starts simple and expands intentionally, without cluttering your workspace or forcing unnecessary replacements.<br><br>Whether you’re beginning with a few essentials or building a serious toolkit over time, the stack adapts with you. Add only what you need. Carry only what you use. Keep everything visible, accessible, and easy to repair.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎DESIGNED TO BE A DESKTOP SCULPTURE:</span><br>The Combine Driver was designed to stay visible, not tucked away.<br>Balanced proportions, honest materials and an architecture that brings a quiet yet bold presence on your desk.<br><br>It’s a tool you reach for often, and one that feels considered even when it’s at rest.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎DESIGNED AS A SYSTEM AND NOT JUST AN OBJECT:</span><br>What appears as a single tool is a carefully considered system. A rotary base, modular stack, and the Combine Driver itself; each designed to work independently, yet composed to function better together.<br><br>Nothing is decorative. Nothing is fixed. <br>Every element exists to support access, adaptability, and repair; whether the tool is in use, being reconfigured, or simply at rest on your desk.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">▎ENTIRE ASSEMBLY HELD TOGETHER BY JUST 6 M3 SCREWS:</span><br>The Combine Driver has no adhesives, lock-tights, permanent welds and environmentally toxic surface treatments, making it fully&nbsp;repairable by you.",
                "Sustainability, for us, meant looking beyond the object and designing the system around it. From disassembly to material use and manufacturing methods, each decision was made with the full <span class=\"bold\">lifecycle</span> in mind.<br><br><span class=\"bold\">▎HERE'S HOW DESIGN AND SYSTEMS THINKING GUIDED OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY:</span>",
                "Committing to mono-materiality, we’ve thoughtfully crafted every component from a single material. The Combine Driver is constructed from&nbsp;Stainless Steel 304,&nbsp;S2 Tool Steel,&nbsp;Aluminum&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nylon&nbsp;for their longevity, precision and true recyclability.",

                "We intentionally engineered the connector housing with additional clearance to accommodate phones with protective cases. The width aligns with your device, while the depth and structural offset are carefully balanced to ensure the connector remains fully accessible — even when a case is installed.",
                "That means no removing your phone case.<br>No forcing tight connections.<br>No awkward pressure against the frame.",
                "The interface area is purposefully spaced to avoid collision with case edges, allowing a clean and secure fit across most standard case designs.",
                "Because everyday phones are protected — and your accessories should respect that.",
                "PortRing is available in two main connector versions: <span class=\"bold\">USB-C</span> and <span class=\"bold\">Lightning</span>.",
                "Simply select your preferred quantity when choosing a reward.<br>After the campaign ends, you’ll be able to choose your connector version in the backer survey. This ensures flexibility while keeping the checkout process simple.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Each unit in a multi-pack reward can be configured individually.</span>",
                "We are a small team of designers and engineers who focus on one thing:<br><span class=\"bold\">making everyday phone accessories smarter, simpler, and more functional.</span>",
                "We believe great products don’t add complexity — they remove it.<br>That’s why we design accessories that integrate directly with your device, using thoughtful structure and engineering instead of bulky add-ons.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">PortRing</span> was born from a simple frustration:<br>phone stands block charging, and charging accessories don’t support viewing.<br>So we rethought the charging port itself — turning it into a structural anchor that supports charging, data transfer, and hands-free use at the same time.",
                "From early sketches to functional prototypes, every detail of PortRing was designed by our team — from the port layout and magnetic balance to real-world case compatibility.",
                "Kickstarter allows us to bring this idea directly to people who value practical, well-designed tools.<br>With your support, we can turn PortRing from a refined prototype into a product used every day."

                "<span class=\"bold\">Never-clean Kat Kolosseum (Patent Pending)</span>",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Introduction</span>",
                "After 30+ years of using different types of cat litter boxes, I grew tired of having to clean boxes, scoops, machines, and machine parts.&nbsp; I decided that I would attempt to design a new cat litter box, that as a minimum, I would only have to clean on an infrequent basis.&nbsp; However, as my design began to take shape, I realized that if I incorporate multiple specific objectives, and that these objectives can be met, the end result will be a cat litter unit that NEVER needs to be cleaned (not including removal of excrement).",
                "The single over-riding objective that must be met in order to be able to claim a ‘never-clean’ status, is that the feline must not be able to reach <span class=\"bold\">any of the supporting structure</span> of the new litter box (i.e. feline only has access to litter).",
                "A subset of objectives (claims) that will support the main objective are as follows:",
                "1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cats love the corners of their litter box.&nbsp; So, we remove the corners!&nbsp; In other words, the new design must be round.",
                "2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cats love to dig down to the bottom of the litter box.&nbsp; To minimize the possibility of reaching the bottom, we design the litter box to be deep.",
                "3.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we keep the cats away from the sides of the litter box?&nbsp; We restrict their movement!&nbsp; The lid of the new design is round with a hole in the center, like a donut!",
                "4.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we simplify the removal of urine clumps and feces?&nbsp; We incorporate a sifting mechanism in the new design.&nbsp; This allows all clean litter to be fully recovered, each time the owner removes cat excrement.",
                "5.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we replace the sifting section without having to transfer all the remaining clean litter, and creating significant dust in the process?&nbsp; A bowl-shaped sifting basket has been included in the new design that ‘slips under’ the remaining clean litter, which does not produce any dust.",
                "Drawings and photos of the final prototype of the new design are as follows:",

                "For months now, we’ve been working behind the scenes on <span class=\"text-italic\">“Oben Ohne”</span>, a magazine series that invites readers to peel back the pages of Unvernunft. Three magazines, three different perspectives, one shared theme. What is Unvernunft, really?<br>How many facets of Unvernunft are there to discover? We want to belong, yet still unfold. We want to dream, but also stay realistic. Along the way, we often feel pressure and sense contradictions rising within us.",
                "The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“No Pressure”</span> draws from personal experiences and observations to explore the many areas of life where Unvernunft hides in the clothing of everyday routines.&nbsp;<br>The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“Rauchapause”</span> longs to hit the pause button, drifting into daydreams and delightfully unvernünftige habits.&nbsp;<br>The magazine <span class=\"text-italic\">“Mischkonsum”</span> refuses to set rules or boundaries, instead awakening the dormant potential for Unvernunft within us.&nbsp;",
                "All three issues share one thing: we question ourselves and offer glimpses into our lives. Through a wide range of illustrations, the articles are told not only through words, but powerfully through our visual worlds.",

                "We need €1,500 to produce our small magazine print run. Printing is planned for March, provided we find enough supporters. We appreciate everyone who gives us young creatives the opportunity to bring such a passionate project to life and hopefully soon hold the scent of freshly printed pages in our hands.",

To fulfill our goal, we opened an Instagram account where you can watch behind the scenes moment or follow our progress. We also opened a Kickstarter campaign, opening the possibility for those who want to financially support us. If we were able to make you interested, we'd be very glad if you'd take a look!

                "The early 1920s marked a period of explosive growth for New York City. Skyscrapers began to pierce the skyline, and neighborhoods filled with families eager to enjoy the comforts of modern living. Among the prized possessions filling these homes were woolen goods—rugs, tapestries, fur coats, sweaters, and suits. Wool, known for its warmth and durability, became a symbol of prosperity and refinement.",
                "But as the city grew denser and more goods were stored away, a silent invader found its opportunity: the carpet moth. These tiny insects, harmless as adults, laid eggs that hatched into larvae—voracious eaters of animal-based fibers. Over time, the damage escalated from a nuisance to a citywide crisis. Homeowners watched in dismay as their prized textiles were devoured from within, the larvae spinning cocoons and emerging as moths to restart the cycle.",
                "The scale of the problem demanded a scientific response. Laboratories across the country, and especially in New York, began searching for a chemical deterrent. By the mid-1920s, researchers discovered that certain fluoride compounds could be highly effective against moth larvae. Among the pioneers was the Larvex Corporation, which patented a water-soluble, non-toxic, and odorless solution: ammonium silicofluoride. This innovation was safe for home use, gentle on wool, and easy to apply—though it required reapplication after cleaning, as it was not permanent.",
                "Still, the quest for a permanent fix continued. Sodium fluoride, paired with an acid solution, offered longer-lasting protection but proved harsh on both wool and skin. Over time, the risks outweighed the benefits, and the industry returned to safer, though temporary, solutions.",
                "The story of mothproofing did not end with Larvex. The company was eventually absorbed by a larger conglomerate, and by the 1930s–40s, both the patents and the formulas faded into obscurity. Yet, the knowledge was not entirely lost. On the East Coast and in select Bay Area rug plants, cleaning specialists continued to use these formulas, passing them down through generations or company sales.",
                "Cary Cleaning Specialists, a Bay Area institution from the 1930s to 1960s, became stewards of the ammonium silicofluoride method. When Simonian Rugs acquired Cary Cleaning Specialists in 1956, they inherited not just a business, but a legacy of textile protection. For decades, Simonian Rugs quietly safeguarded the region’s rugs and tapestries, using a formula that had all but disappeared elsewhere.",
                "In the 1970s, Joseph Bezjidian, owner of Simonian Rug Cleaners, formally acquired Cary’s mothproofing solution and continued to use it in his facility. The Simonian family, drawing on generations of expertise in textile care, maintained the tradition, even as the rest of the industry moved on to other methods—freezing, heat treatments, mothballs, and scented deterrents. These alternatives, while helpful, often failed to match the effectiveness and safety of the original formula.",
                "In 2008, Austin Reinders took ownership of Simonian Rugs, unaware that he was now the custodian of a nearly lost piece of textile history. For years, the formula was offered as a specialized service, protecting countless heirlooms and everyday items. It wasn’t until 2024, at a rug cleaning convention, that Austin realized just how rare the solution had become. Colleagues from across the country described their reliance on physical methods and scented repellents—none had access to the odorless, effective formula that Simonian Rugs had quietly preserved.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/609/498/8b6a66abb6bfd23677baf1538fde1de1_original.jpg?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1771119798&amp;width=4032&amp;sig=Yb%2F%2BjKLdkXR5WZnT6uR4PflXlhoUiQ%2BkYvglzDB%2Bkhc%3D\" data-id=\"52609498\">",
                "Recognizing a unique opportunity, Austin set out to bring the solution to the public. Woolle was born—a brand with a modern identity, designed to make mothproofing accessible, safe, and effective for everyone. With a carefully chosen color palette (dark blue, white, and salmon) and thoughtfully designed kits, Woolle empowers consumers to protect their woolen treasures at home. Each kit includes a gallon of mothproofing spray, a funnel for mixing concentrate with distilled water, and a fine-mist spray bottle for easy application.",
                "Before announcing Woolle to the public, we wanted to ensure that our solution would be safe for homes, families, and treasured garments. Here’s what we found:",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Ammonium silicofluoride</span> (also known as ammonium fluorosilicate), with the formula (NH₄)₂SiF₆, is a white, water-soluble crystalline powder. It’s non-staining, odorless, and has a long history of safe use in textile care when properly diluted.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Origin:</span> Industrially, ammonium silicofluoride is produced by reacting ammonia with hexafluorosilicic acid—a byproduct of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing. Historically, it could also be found as a secondary byproduct in the ash from burning coal or from volcanic activity, where natural minerals react to form similar compounds.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Safety:</span> When diluted for textile use, ammonium silicofluoride is considered low-toxicity, non-combustible, and safe for home environments. It does not leave harmful residues or odors. We have verified its safety profile through reputable sources, including PubChem, CAMEO Chemicals, and industry literature.",
                "<span class=\"bold\">Effectiveness:</span> The compound works by dehydrating moth larvae, disrupting their lifecycle and preventing damage to wool, cashmere, and other animal-based fibers. Its water solubility allows for easy, even application on garments and rugs.",
                "We chose this formula because it offers the best combination of safety, effectiveness, and ease of use. Woolle is gentle on your favorite sweaters and heirloom rugs—giving you peace of mind and real protection without harsh chemicals or lingering scents.",
                "Woolle stands as a testament to the power of tradition, innovation, and family stewardship. For over a century, the secrets of effective mothproofing were nearly lost—buried by corporate mergers, forgotten by changing industries, and safeguarded by a handful of dedicated practitioners. Today, Woolle revives this legacy, offering a proven, non-toxic, and water-based solution to a new generation of textile lovers.",
                "Through Woolle, the world’s woolen treasures can once again be protected—just as they were in the golden age of New York’s textile boom. The lost solution has found its way home.",

                "&nbsp;Queen grew up \"off leash\" and constantly exploring, we often were moving around within her first few years and constantly on the go. We settled in a town North of Miami, where when I would walk Q off leash I often was getting a lot of negative feedback. However she never left my side, bothered anyone, and was always well behaved I didn't think she deserved to have to be tied to 3 feet directly to my hand. We enjoyed roller blading, bike riding, beach runs all without the need of a leash. &nbsp;",
                "Then came the time, where we just had to be on a leash - I started to find a way to give her the freedom I wanted her to have, until we got to where we were going to set her free. It started with cheap 'hands free' leashes with bad designs, inexpensive packs, constantly getting loose or not fitting correctly, falling off my waist, not stylish. I didn't think there was much in the market for me. After brainstorming, coming up with some ideas and a LOT of product sampling, I finally was able to create something I could use and thought was stylish.&nbsp;",
                "Prototype development began, and testing has been ongoing. I have now personally been using my prototype over a year without any issue and have slowly been working to get a product to market. Who knew how expensive being passionate about animals could be..",
                "This started as a bit of a passion project for me, and turned into something I want to be able to offer the public. An affordable, stylish, well made product with functionality to allow them a little more freedom while walking their pup. The idea is to secure some funding to build inventory, create more colors, advance some of the prototypes moving beyond just this version 1. Growing the Q Pet Products into a complete brand that offers a multitude of well thought out products making life easier for pet owners.&nbsp;",

That’s why we have created DIANE, an expandable handcrafted tote bag, designed in France, and built to follow every step of your journey. Relying on over 40 years of experience in sourcing, design and craftsmanship for some of the most luxurious international brands, we are launching our first independent collection!",

                "The idea behind this project comes from a frustration we’ve had for years: finding a tote that could truly keep up with our lives. Most leather totes look beautiful at first sight, but when you actually live with them, their limits quickly appear. They are often too rigid, too heavy, and lock you into a fixed shape that only works some of the time. On the other hand, the more flexible options we tried were practical, but lacked the timeless style and craftsmanship that make a bag a pleasure to carry every day.",
                "In short, we were always forced to choose: either beauty without functionality, or practicality without elegance. And the more we searched, the more we felt that this compromise was unnecessary. Why couldn’t a tote be both refined and adaptive? Why couldn’t it respect tradition, yet reinvent itself for modern life?",
                "That’s when Diane was born. Instead of accepting the existing rules, we decided to create our own solution <span class=\"bold\">-</span> a tote that expands or contracts according to your needs, handcrafted in smooth leather, and rooted in Parisian originality.

Smooth, durable leather for the structure, and lightweight, water-resistant nylon for the body.

                "<span class=\"bold\">3- Not “just a tote”</span><br>The Diane expands when you need it, and stays minimal when you don’t. It’s two bags in one: a sleek everyday model and a larger tote bag. A modular system that adapts to your lifestyle instead of forcing you to adapt to the bag.",

                "<span class=\"bold\">5- A fair price for true value</span><br>While other luxury brands charge <span class=\"bold\">500–1,200€</span> for comparable bags, we keep our price fair by going direct-to-consumer. No middlemen, no retail markups, just honest pricing for a premium original product.",
                "And for our <span class=\"bold\">Kickstarter backers only</span>, we’re offering the Medium sized Diane at <span class=\"bold\">230€ </span>and Large sized one at <span class=\"bold\">280€</span> instead of the future retail prices of 295€ and 350€ - as well as some early backer rewards!",
                "We believe luxury should not come at the expense of the planet. That’s why we carefully select <span class=\"bold\">leathers from responsibly managed tanneries</span>, minimize waste during cutting and production, avoid all unnecessary chemicals, and use <span class=\"bold\">eco-conscious felt packaging </span>that can be easily repurposed.

            "biography": "I have always been driven by creativity. From an early age, I immersed myself in the performing arts, actively participating in theatre as a thespian. The discipline of rehearsals, the intensity of stage lights, and the responsibility of conveying emotion before an audience shaped my understanding of expression and storytelling. Music has remained equally important in my life; I often return to the piano, allowing creativity to guide me, especially during challenging moments.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up across several African countries, I was exposed to a rich diversity of languages, cultures, rhythms, and traditions. These experiences profoundly influenced how I see the world and how I approach creative work. Relocating to Canada as a teenager required me to navigate a new cultural environment while preserving the depth of my heritage. A pivotal moment came when I first walked a runway. That experience awakened a new level of confidence and self-assurance, reinforcing the importance of identity and presence.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, I founded **Bold & Modern Global Culture (B&M)** in Montreal, Quebec. What began as a vision developed independently from my room—with limited resources but strong determination—has grown into a purpose-driven fashion brand. B&M blends authentic cultural influences with refined, modern streetwear design. The goal is to create pieces—hoodies, jackets, and accessories—that allow individuals to celebrate their heritage in a contemporary and empowering way.\r\n\r\nFor me, this brand is deeply personal. Each design carries a narrative, much like theatre and music. I want every person who wears B&M to feel pride in their roots, confidence in their identity, and connection to a broader global community. Beyond fashion, the brand is committed to giving back through cultural workshops and community initiatives that support creativity and self-expression.\r\n\r\nFaith remains central to my journey- God first, always.\r\n\r\nI continue to combine creativity with technical skill, coding professionally while building the future of B&M. The vision is long-term: to build something meaningful, impactful, and culturally unifying.\r\n\r\nwww.bmglobalculture.com",

My work is a bridge between the ancient wisdom of crystal energy and the clean, understated elegance of modern Canadian design.\r\n\r\nWith a deep-rooted passion for energy culture, I spent years studying the vibrational properties of minerals. I found that most spiritual jewelry was either too ornate or too heavy for a contemporary lifestyle. This led me to develop a signature style centered on 4mm micro-beads and precision-cut facets, creating pieces that feel like a delicate extension of the wearer.\r\n\r\nMy design philosophy is simple: Intention in every bead. I hand-select 7A-grade natural stones not just for their aesthetic brilliance, but for their ability to bring focus, serenity, and confidence to the modern soul. By integrating 14K Gold-Filled elements, I ensure each piece is as durable as it is beautiful—a timeless companion for your daily journey",

Brenda’s work has shaped the game industry for decades, yet her story represents something even bigger than games: <span class=\"bold\">it’s about daring to build worlds when the real one doesn’t always make space for you</span>.&nbsp;",
                "Through Theresa’s lens, we explore not just a remarkable career, but the heart, humor, and humanity behind it. <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Game On</span></span> is joyful, thoughtful, and fiercely inspiring, just like the woman at its center. Women filmmakers and women game developers have often been the hidden architects of our stories and our play. When we celebrate women who design our games and women who direct our films, we expand who gets to imagine, who gets to lead, and who gets to be remembered.",

We need your help to <span class=\"bold\">complete post-production</span> and <span class=\"bold\">jumpstart distribution and impact campaigns</span> to bring <span class=\"text-italic\"><span class=\"bold\">Game On</span></span> to the world.

She treats the board and video games she creates as an opportunity to both entertain players and amplify important social issues. Her games explore cultural histories including Black, Indigenous, Irish, Mexican and Jewish, in ways that challenge us.",

She and her husband, legendary game developer John Romero, are on a mission to do what they love while raising four kids in an ethnically-blended family. Brenda helms the production of a new game, and opens up a timely discussion about sexism in the gaming world.<img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/052/219/347/6729d67c6039f0736037ebfb6e3a52ea_original.png?fit=scale-down&amp;origin=ugc&amp;q=92&amp;v=1768412968&amp;width=1700&amp;sig=0J%2Fm%2BPktm2CydTPhxqgOG1QOzmNzY654g1O1dfPvNow%3D\" data-id=\"52219347\">",

My goal for the film is to increase &nbsp;awareness of her contributions, magnify her impact and smash stereotypes of what women have been, are, and can be as artists and social activists. I want the public to know Barbara Dane so that they may feel empowered to take action in their own way, just as she did. That&nbsp;change can take time, but it is worth it.

                "SCP:GALLIONIC is an independent animated short film following the events after a catastrophic containment breach through the eyes of Matthew Vestergaard, a simple accountant working on the outskirts of the facility, and the events leading up to said breach through Jane Vestergaard, a young researcher at the facility and Matthew’s older sister. Jane is helplessly frustrated&nbsp;with the facility's status quo in which containment breaches seem to be a common occurrence and the loss of staff is just part of the job. She is worried this mass apathy could lead to a catastrophic containment breach and has to scramble for a solution to all of this. Matthew, on the other hand, decides to venture within the facility after said catastrophic event, with no knowledge of what happened or even what is in this place, but with the sole goal of saving his sister.",
                "The story explores theme of control over one's surroundings and selves. Whilst the story is based&nbsp;on various lore from the&nbsp; SCP wiki, <span class=\"bold\">it is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of it to fully enjoy this short</span>. If anything we hope this short gets more people curious about SCP and all that it brings!&nbsp;",
                "Working in the outskirts of the main facility as a simple accountant, Matthew passes his days in relative tranquillity, not having to bear the knowledge of what is kept within the facility. His attitude however suddenly changes when a catastrophic containment breach occurs at the site, and he together with the few who were outside of the facility are left without any information of what happened. With rescue being unavailable and the threat of the whole place self-destructing, Matthew decides to venture into the facility and find his sister, despite knowing the near impossibility of the task.",
                "As a young 29 year old researcher at site 19-2, Jane, like many others, is tasked with the observation and research of various anomalies contained within the facility. As time goes on, she witnesses multiple breaches, in which anomalies escape containment, wreaking havoc within the site and leaving many casualties. However, what shocks her the most are not the breaches in it of themselves, but everyone's seeming apathy towards them. She worries that this will lead to complacency, and sooner or later, a catastrophic breach, which could put in serious risk the entire site, if not the world at large. Therefore she desperately starts searching for a possible solution to all of this before it's too late.",
                "Virgil is a senior facility guard working on the facility's perimeter who's only job is that of making sure nothing enters the site. Despite having worked within the facility in his early days, he quickly realised he'd much prefer a calmer albeit more boring position outside, as a patrol officer. However, when finding out his friend, Matthew, was going to enter the facility alone after The catastrophic containment breach, he decides to accompany him and become his guide through the maze like structure, aiding him in finding his sister, despite knowing the risks, and that they might never come back.",
                "Jessica is a senior researcher at site 19-2 with multiple years of experience and a discrete level of authority within the site. Despite having seen many things over the years, she remains light-hearted and easy going, which seems to mesh well with Jane, as the two quickly become friends, helping out one another, leading to Jessica empathising with Jane’s sentiment, and deciding to help her in some shape or form.",

                "As the biggest and most ambitious facility, Site 19-2 was built from the ground up in an undisclosed part of Alaska with the idea of containing as many anomalies in one single place as possible. When the idea for such a site was proposed to the board it was heavily criticised for its seeming danger, as one single catastrophic breach could put at risk many thousands of anomalies. However, through thorough testing and research, both in the architecture of the facility, together with its logistics and security systems, proved it near impossible for such an event to happen.",
                "After such conclusion, what made the proposal even more appealing was the logistic and energy simplicity, as resources could be more easily concentrated in one single area instead of being spread out across multiple facilities, which made everything from resupplying to re-containment much easier.&nbsp;",
                "The facility now houses over 100'000 active personnel, and one third of all actively containable non-indestructible SCPs, which means it is much closer to a city than a laboratory. Because of it's remote and hostile location, the foundation has taken extra steps in ensuring the wellbeing and comfort of all staff, so as to reduce any unwanted psychological stress and maintain maximum efficiency.",

                "This project has been a long time coming. We've worked out the script, concept art, characters and even made a proof of concept trailer, but we now want to take it a step further, and make this project become a reality.",

We want to put to good use our abilities and passions so as to create something worthy of everyone's time. To say we put our hearts and souls into this would be an understatement. That's why we came to Kickstarter: we want to deliver the best of the best, and for that we need resources to compensate everyone who's helping us on this endeavour, whilst also retaining artistic freedom as we don't have to rely on external third party producers.",

I must say, though, not having even nearly the same page count for softcover artbook pledgers made me a little glum. Two-thirds less does sting, considering the art book was a main draw for me, aside from just supporting the project overall, of course :) I hope that might be reconsidered in some way. ",
